0,What happens to government borrowing costs when its debt-to-GDP ratio gets too high?,"['FY 2024 REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) 168 Fiscal Projections in Context In this Financial Report , a sustainable fiscal policy is defined as one where the federal debt -to-GDP ratio is stable or declining over the projection period. However, this definition does not indicate what a sustainable debt -to-GDP ratio might be. Any particular debt ratio is not the ultimate goal of fiscal policy. Rather, the goals of fiscal policy are many including financing public goods, such as infrastructure and government services; promoting a strong and growing economy; and managing the debt so that it is not a burden on future generations. These goals are interrelated, and readers should consider how policies intended to affect one might depend on or affect another. This Financial Report shows that current policy under this Financial R eport’s assumptions is not sustainable. In evaluating policies that could make policy sustainable, note that debt may play roles in both facilitating and hindering a healthy economy. For example, government deficit spending supports demand and allows the economy to emerge from recessions more quickly. Debt may also be a cost -effective means of financing capital investment that promotes future economic growth, which may in turn make future debt levels more manageable. However, economic theory also suggests that high levels of debt may contribute to higher interest rates, leading to lower private investment and a smaller capital stock that the economy can use to grow. Unfortunately, it is unclear what debt -to-GDP ratio would be sufficiently high to produce these negative outcomes, or whether the key concern is the level of debt per se, or a trend that shows debt increasing over time. While several empirical studies have attempted to discern a definite relationship between debt and economic growth from the past experience of countries, the evidence is mixed. One study suggested that debt -to-GDP ratios in excess of 90 percent had significant negative consequences for real GDP growth across advanced countries . 5 Real GDP growth is generally lower by about 1 percent when the countries’ debt -to-GDP ratios are above 90 percent relative to the times when they are below 90 percent. 6 However, after removing sample countries with very high indebtedness – those with debt-to-GDP ratios of more than 120 percent – and very low indebtedness – those with debt -to-GDP ratios of less than 30 percent – the negative relationship between growth and debt is difficult to determine. Another study reports that differences in average GDP growth in countries with debt -to-GDP ratios between 30 -60 percent, 60- 90 percent, and 90 -120 percent cannot be statistically distinguished. 7 Some countries with high debt -to-GDP ratios have been observed to experience lower -than- average growth, while other countries with similarly high debt -to-GDP ratios have continued to enjoy robust growth. Analogously, low debt -to-GDP ratios are no guarantee of strong economic growth. Moreover, the direction of causality is 5 Reinhart, Carmen M., Vincent R. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff. 2012. “Public Debt Overhangs: Advanced-Economy Episodes Since 1800.” Journal of Economic Perspectives, 26(3):69.86. 6 Errata: “Growth in a Time of Debt,” Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S.

High debt may undermine growth through increased interest rates and lower business confidence, or low growth may contribute to high debt by depressing tax revenues and increasing deficit spending on social safety net programs. Nevertheless, to put the current and projected debt -to-GDP ratios in context, it is instructive to examine how the U.S. experience compares with that of other countries. The U.S. government’s debt as a percent of GDP is relatively large compared with central government debt of other countries, but far from the largest among developed countries. Based on historical data as reported by the IMF for 2 9 advanced economies, the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2022 ranged from 12.4 percent of GDP to 213.2 percent of GDP. 8 The U.S. is not included in this set of statistics, which underscores the difficulty in calculating debt ratios under consistent definitions, but the 2024 debt -to-GDP ratio for the U.S. government was approximately 98 percent. Despite using consistent definitions where available, these debt measures are not strictly comparable due to differences in the share of government debt that is debt of the central government, how government responsibilities are shared between central and local governments, how current policies compare with the past policies that determine the current level of debt, and how robustly each economy grows. The historical experience of the U.S. may also provide some perspective. As Chart 4 shows, the debt -to-GDP ratio was highest in the 1940s, following the debt buildup during World War II. In the projections in this Financial Report , the U.S. would reach the previous peak debt ratio in 2028. However, the origins of current and future federal debt are quite different from the wartime debt of the 1940s, which limits the pertinence of past experience. As the cross-country and historical comparisons suggest, there is a very imperfect relationship between the current level of central government debt and the sustainability of overall government policy. Past accrual of debt is certainly important, but current policies and their implications for future debt accumulation and future growth are as well. 8 Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, Main Aggregates and Balances, available at Data are for D1 debt liabilities for the central government, excluding social security funds, for Advanced Economies.', '25 FY 2024 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (with some adjustments), is subject to a statutory ceiling (i.e., the debt limit). Note that when intra -governmental debt decreases, debt held by the public will increase by an equal amount (if the general account of the U .S. government is in deficit), so that there is no net effect on gross f ederal debt. At the end of FY 2024, debt subject to the statutory limit was $35.4 trillion.13 The federal debt held by the public measured as a percent of GDP (debt -to-GDP ratio) (Chart 7) compares the country’s debt to the size of its economy, making this measure sensitive to changes in both. Over time, the debt-to-GDP ratio has varied widely: • For most of the nation’s history, through the first half of the 20 th century, the debt -to-GDP ratio has tended to increase during wartime and decline during peacetime. • Chart 7 shows that wartime spending and borrowing pushed the debt -to-GDP ratio to an all- time high of 106 percent in 1946, soon after the end of World War II, but it decreased rapidly in the post-war years. • The ratio grew rapidly from the mid- 1970s until the early 1990s. Strong economic growth and fundamental fiscal decisions, including measures to reduce the federal deficit and implementation of binding PAYGO rules (which require that new tax or spending laws not add to the deficit), generated a significant decline in the debt -to-GDP ratio, from a peak of 48 percent in FYs 1993-1995, to 31 percent in 2001. • The debt-to-GDP ratio rose significantly in 2008- 2009 during the financial crisis and again in 2020- 2021 during the pandemic reflecting the government’s responses to both events and the resulting significant spending and deficit increases, as well as the economic challenges experienced during both periods. • During the first decade of the 21 st century, PAYGO rules were allowed to lapse, significant tax cuts were implemented, entitlements were expanded, and spending related to defense and homeland security increased. By September 2008, the debt-to-GDP ratio was 39 percent of GDP. • PAYGO rules were reinstated in 2010, but the extraordinary demands of the 2008 economic and financial crisis and the consequent actions taken by the federal government, combined with slower economic growth in the wake of the crisis, pushed the debt-to-GDP ratio up to 74 percent by the end of FY 2014. • The extraordinary demands of the pandemic, the government’s response, and pressures on the economy contributed to a rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio to approximately 100 percent during FY 2020 and FY 2021. • The debt was approximately 98 percent of GDP at the end of FY 2024. This ratio in creased during FY 2024 because debt grew faster than GDP.14,15 From Chart 7, since 1940, the average debt-to-GDP ratio is 51 percent. See Note 29 —Subsequent Events for information about events that occurred after the end of the fiscal year that may affect the government’s financial position and condition. 13 In FY 2023, Treasury faced a delay in raising the debt limit that required it to depart from its normal debt management proce dures and invoke legal authorities to avoid exceeding the statutory debt limit. During this period, extraordinary measures taken by Treasury resulted in federal debt securities not being issued to certain federal government accounts with the securities being restored, including lost interest, to the affec ted government accounts subsequent to the end of the delay period. Due to th e delay in raising the statutory debt limit, Treasury took extraordinary measures from January 19,', '39,130 40,872 42,748 44,781 46,828 48,910 51,083 53,590 56,396 59,207 Debt subject to limitd 35,355 37,333 39,253 40,994 42,869 44,902 46,950 49,033 51,207 53,715 56,522 59,334 Average interest rate on debt held by the public (percent) 3.3 3.4 3.3 3.4 3.4 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.6 3.6 3.6 3.6 Data sources: Congressional Budget Office; Department of the Treasury.

In the coming weeks, the Department of the Treasury is expected to announce a “debt issuance suspension period” and to take “extraordinary measures” to borrow additional funds without breaching the debt limit. The Deficit Control Act requires CBO to project spending, revenues, and deficits independently of the debt limit. For more details, see Congressional Budget Office, Federal Debt and the Statutory Limit, February 2023 (February 2023),', 'FY 2024 STATEMENT OF THE COMPTROLLER GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES 48 Report) show that, based on current revenue and spending policies, the federal government continues to face an unsustainable long-term fiscal path. GAO and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) prepare long-term federal fiscal simulations, which also continue to show federal debt held by the public rising as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) in the long term.27 This situation—in which debt held by the public grows faster than GDP—means the federal government’s long-term fiscal path is unsustainable. GAO, CBO, and the 2024 Financial Report, although using somewhat different assumptions, all project that debt held by the public as a share of GDP (debt-to-GDP) will surpass its historical high (106 percent in 1946) by 2028. Health care and Social Security remain key drivers of federal noninterest spending in the long-term projections. In addition, GAO, CBO and the 2024 Financial Report project that net interest spending will continue to grow and assume an increasingly larger share of federal spending. As debt levels grow, the government typically must spend more on interest. Moreover, rising interest rates can increase the government’s interest costs. In fiscal year 2024, net interest spending of $881.7 billion (primarily interest on debt held by the public) was more than budget outlays for national defense or for Medicare. The 2024 Financial Report provides an estimate of the magnitude of policy changes needed to achieve a target debt-to-GDP ratio of 98 percent (the 2024 level) in 2099 (the fiscal gap).28 Policymakers could close the fiscal gap, achieving the target ratio, through a combination of revenue increases and noninterest spending reductions. For example, the fiscal gap could be closed by increasing projected annual revenue by 22.5 percent, reducing projected annual noninterest spending by 19.0 percent, or some combination of the two. The projections show that the longer policy changes are delayed, the more significant the magnitude of policy changes will need to be to achieve the debt-to-GDP target. GAO issues an annual report on the fiscal health of the federal government, which provides more information on actions that Congress and the administration can consider to help address the federal government’s unsustainable long-term fiscal path. 29 Since 2017, we have suggested that Congress develop a strategy to place the federal government on a sustainable fiscal path—where government spending and revenue result in a stable or declining debt-to-GDP ratio over the long term. It is vital that the United States remains in a strong economic position to meet its social and security needs, as well as to preserve flexibility to address unforeseen events, such as an economic downturn or large-scale disaster. A strategy can provide a cohesive picture of the government’s long-term goals and can serve as a mechanism for building consensus around these goals. We have reported on elements the strategy could include, such as the following:30 • Establishing fiscal rules and targets to help frame and control the overall results of spending and revenue decisions that affect the debt. 27For more information on GAO’s simulations, see GAO, The Nation’s Fiscal Health: Road Map Needed to Address Projected Unsustainable Debt Levels, GAO-24-106987 (Washington, D.C.: Feb. 15, 2024). For more information on CBO’s simulations, see Congressional Budget Office, An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: 2024 to 2034 (Washington, D.C.: June 18, 2024). 28Fiscal gap can also be calculated using different time horizons and different target debt-to-GDP ratios. GAO projects a fiscal gap for a 30-year period. For more information, see GAO, “Interactive Graphic: Exploring the Tough Choices for a Sustainable Fiscal Path,” accessed January']","Based on the available information, when a government's debt-to-GDP ratio gets too high, it can lead to higher interest rates. This can result in lower private investment and a smaller capital stock that the economy can use to grow. However, it's important to note that the relationship between high debt-to-GDP ratios and economic growth is not straightforward. Some studies suggest that debt-to-GDP ratios in excess of 90 percent have significant negative consequences for real GDP growth, while others report that the relationship between growth and debt is difficult to determine. High debt may undermine growth through increased interest rates and lower business confidence, or low growth may contribute to high debt by depressing tax revenues and increasing deficit spending on social safety net programs.
