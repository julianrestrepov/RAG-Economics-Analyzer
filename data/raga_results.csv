0,What factors determine whether migration flows yield economic gains for both origin and destination countries?,"['International Monetary Fund | April 2025 75 Emerging market and developing economies have found themselves increasingly on the receiving end of migrant and refugee flows, hosting the lion’s share of the latter. This chapter examines how an economy’s policies to manage legal inflows of migrants and refugees can have important spillovers to other destination and transit economies, as well as the economies from which these flows originate. Tighter policies in other jurisdictions can increase inflows to a given economy by 10 percent over five years. Fur- thermore, output in an average economy receiving these additional inflows can increase by 0.2 percent over the same horizon. The overall effect on output can often be modest, as inflows can strain local resources and refugees tend to be less well matched with skills needs in local labor markets. However, output effects can be larger should the skills of migrants and refugees complement those of natives. The policy emphasis is on improving the integration of migrants and refugees and minimizing skills mismatches. In emerging market and developing economies, the returns from better integrating refugees can be particularly large. Furthermore, measures are needed to alleviate pressures on local services and infrastructure, by prioritizing productive public investment and pro- moting private sector development. International policy cooperation can help distribute the short-term costs of hosting large and unexpected inflows more evenly across economies and improve outcomes over the long term.

Flows, as a share of the global population, steadily increased from the late 1990s The authors of this chapter are Paula Beltran Saavedra, Nicolas Fernandez-Arias, Shushanik Hakobyan, Samuel Mann, Neil Meads, and Carolina Osorio Buitron, under the guidance of Aqib Aslam, and with support from Shan Chen, Camara Kidd, Xiaomeng Mei, and Johannes Rosenbusch.

As of 2024, the global stock of legal migrants and refugees had reached 304 million—or 3.7 percent of the global population—almost double that observed in 1995, with about one in six being refugees or asylum seekers. Furthermore, about 40 percent of migrants and 75 percent of refugees now reside in emerging market and developing economies. These patterns are the result of “pull” and “push” factors—including geopolitical shocks and natural disasters, which have increased in frequency—and the configuration of migration and refugee policies. Policies in destination economies, in particular, are likely to have played an important role by altering frictions—and therefore the costs and benefits— associated with individual migration decisions. Just as policies have helped shape the level and com- position of observed legal flows, so too have changes in the acceptance of migrants and refugees, which has been deteriorating in several major destination economies (Figure 3.2, panel 1). Increased media cov- erage of migration has further driven policy discourse (Figure 3.2, panel 2). Survey responses suggest that migration-related pressures are also unlikely to abate, because the intention to migrate remains robust despite the inability of all potential migrants to reach their preferred destination (Figure 3.2, panel 3). Migrants from emerging market and developing economies often aspire to move to advanced economies—either within or outside their region—but they are more likely to end up in other nearby economies within the same income group.

Several important features drive the modeling results. Individuals choose whether and where to migrate and which pathway to use, given policy and nonpolicy migration costs, as well as the real wages they can earn in different destinations, which reflect factors such as the complementarity of their skills with those of residents. The economic impact of policy- induced changes in flows depends largely on two opposing forces: (1) agglomeration, wherein a net inflow of migrants can lead to higher total factor productivity from, for example, knowledge spillovers and increased entrepreneurship; and (2) congestion, which stems from increasing strain on local services, businesses’ equip- ment and properties, and publicly provided infrastruc- ture, such that an increase in population lowers capital per worker in the short to medium term (Saiz 2007; Melo, Graham, and Noland 2009; Kline and Moretti 2013; Colas and Sachs 2024). Over the long term, economies that successfully build capital can reap the benefits of net migration flows, increasing potential output per capita. Distributional Implications of Targeted Migration Policies In the first exercise, tighter policies in a destination economy that target migrants from certain origin economies are assumed to reduce the stock of migrants from these economies by 20 percent over the short to medium term relative to the baseline. 16 As a result, 0.25 percent more of the native population remains in the origin economies (origin suppression). At the same time, flows—of both low- and high-skilled refugees— through the refugee pathway increase (categorical substi- tution). Relative to the baseline, low-skilled refugee flows increase by 4 percent, and high-skilled refugee flows increase by 0.5 percent (Figure 3.10, panel 1). 16These flows tend to be small as a share of the overall population in the destination economy. In this exercise, migrants account for 0.3 percent of the population from the origin countries and roughly half of that amount when measured in percent of the population in the destination economy. The 20 percent reduction in economic migration is broadly comparable to the predicted outflows following a one-standard-deviation increase in labor migration indices from the Immigration Policies in Comparison (IMPIC) database—which capture migration tightening of policies targeted at migrants. The exercise also finds significant deflection of migrants toward bordering destination economies (destination substitution). The increase in flows to these alternative destinations from the targeted origin economies is broad-based across migrants and refugees, although larger in the case of low-skilled refugees, which increase by 2 percent (Figure 3.10, panel 2). The increased inflows of low-skilled refugees reflect relatively lower barriers for this pathway compared with the base- line, and the prospect of higher incomes for low-skilled workers. The results also indicate that the implement- ing jurisdiction receives larger flows of low-skilled migrants and refugees from economies bordering those to which the tighter migration policies were targeted (origin substitution). By contrast, a higher share of high- skilled workers from these bordering economies refrain from emigrating altogether to take advantage of the productivity gains from skill complementarities with the deflected low-skilled workers and agglomeration.

At the same time, migrants are deflected toward bordering economies. ◦ The cumulative economic impact in the short to medium term is a modest lowering of GDP in destination economies, with a small boost to out- put elsewhere because their labor supply increases. ◦ In economies that have received deflected migrants or refugees, increased competition may reduce wages for some workers—notably in the short term—while the incomes of natives engaged in activities complementary to the skills of incom- ing migrants and refugees increase.\nCHAPTER 3 JOURNEyS AND JUNCTIONS: SPILLO vERS FROM MIgRATION AND REFUgEE POLICIES 87International Monetary Fund | April 2025 population of advanced destination economies— averaging about 2 percent over five years. • Spillovers from migration and refugee policy shifts propagate globally through a mix of channels— primarily destination substitution and categorical substitution—with macroeconomic implications.

Strengthening incentives to take up formal work—including through well-designed tax and transfer systems and improved access to public health and educa- tion services—can help these economies reap the benefits of these inflows. ◦ More broadly, integration efforts across desti- nation economies require minimizing domestic barriers to occupational mobility.

The scale of migrant and refugee flows—as well as their integration—can drive economic outcomes in destination economies in the short and long term through changes in labor supply, aggregate demand, congestion, and agglomeration (see Online Annex 3.1 for key definitions, additional details, and labor market outcomes).2 As a result, inflows of people can have positive effects on output and labor productiv- ity, although (concentrated) increases can drive up short-term costs by straining local infrastructure and reducing capital-to-labor ratios. Effects can also vary according to pathways—refugees tend to face higher barriers to integration and greater skills mismatches than migrants. The chapter takes existing push and pull factors and migration barriers as given. It starts by documenting key global and regional trends regarding the direction and composition of legal migration and refugee stocks and flows and the evolution of related policies. It then provides a primer on potential spillovers induced by migration and refugee policy changes before presenting empirical evidence on spillovers from such changes, both for legal migration and refugee flows and output. Motivated by this empirical evidence, the final section uses model-based analysis to quantify the growth and long-term welfare impacts of changes in migration and refugee policies—taking into account different pathways and skills. It also provides insights on how international policy coordination can improve out- comes compared with unilateral measures in response to forced-displacement shocks. The main conclusions of the chapter are as follows: • Legal migration and refugee flows have been rising, with an increasing role for movement between emerging market and developing economies— particularly for refugees—and with strain being placed on economies with often limited absorptive capacity. • Rising flows, public discourse, and tensions in key advanced economy destinations have gone hand in hand with migration and refugee policy tight- ening over time, potentially adding to challenges faced by emerging market and developing economy destinations. 2All online annexes are available at www/imf.org/en/Publications/ WEO. • There is evidence at the global level that spillovers from migration and refugee policy changes work through several channels. These spillovers can be significant in terms of flows of people, but relatively modest in terms of output for the average economy. ◦ Policy tightening that deters inflows by 20 percent in one set of economies can result in a significant deflection of people—increasing inflows to other economies by 10 percent cumulatively over five years. Furthermore, policy changes can alter the composition of inflows to a destination economy: For example, tighter policies that reduce migrant inflows by 20 percent over five years can be partly offset by a 30 percent increase in the typically smaller inflows of refu- gees over the same period. ◦ Deflected flows to the final destination— equivalent to an average increase in the immigrant share of its population of about 0.2 percentage points—are associated with a 0.2 percent increase in output after five years. ◦ Instead, if other countries tighten only their refugee policies, the resulting diversion of refugees does not generate meaningful output gains in the final destination. However, stronger refugee integration policies can deliver better outcomes, notably among emerging market and developing economies. • Model-based simulations highlight how policies that deflect legal flows of migrants and refugees to other destinations or induce them to pursue alternative legal pathways can have economic implications between and within destination economies, depend- ing on the degree of labor market integration and skills matches. ◦ A reduction in legal migration inflows from policies targeting selected origin economies is partly offset by an increase in refugees from those economies—particularly low-skilled refugees. At the same time, migrants are deflected toward bordering economies. ◦ The cumulative economic impact in the short\nSkill Level 84 Figure 3.11.

Furthermore, esti- mates suggest that a tightening of refugee policies by a set of destinations—designed to reduce refugee inflows into those economies by 60 percent over one year—is associated with an increase in refugee inflows into other economies of close to 8 percent within one year (Figure 3.9, panel 2). Deflected refugee inflows result- ing from stricter refugee policies elsewhere—capturing destination substitution effects—do not generate meaningful output gains on average, given absorption challenges. However, estimates using indicators with a better coverage of integration policies—such as naturalization and greater ease of movement within a country—indicate that output effects are much larger for emerging market and developing destination econ- omies where integration policies are stronger (Online Annex 3.3). Beyond aggregate output effects, shifts in migration flows can have broad-ranging macroeconomic impacts on destination economies. For instance, empirical studies find positive impacts of immigration on productivity—often attributed to complementarities between native and immigrant workers (Peri 2011; Ortega and Peri 2014; Alesina, Harnoss, and Rapoport 2015; Jaumotte, Koloskova, and Saxena 2016). Such complementarities are also cited by the literature for limited evidence that migration affects the wages or employment of native workers (Kerr and Kerr 2011; Peri 2014). High-skilled immigration, in particu- lar, is associated with better economic outcomes, including higher wages for natives and enhanced firm performance. The results from the gravity model suggest that there are spillovers from changes in migration and refugee policies. However, care is required to inter- pret them: Migration and refugee flows may influ- ence policies rather than the other way around, and measurement error may exist, resulting from, among other factors, lack of comprehensive data on bilateral migration policies.14 Nonetheless, questions remain regarding the macroeconomic implications of policy spillovers for the global economy and their welfare impacts given the existence of multiple spillover chan- nels, alternative legal pathways for immigration, and various integration frictions. Modeling Spillovers from Migration and Refugee Policy Changes In this section, a spatial dynamic general equilib- rium model of trade and migration is used to conduct two exercises that evaluate (1) the distributional impli- cations of targeted migration and refugee policy tight- ening and the associated costs and benefits to different economies over varying time horizons; and (2) whether international coordination can generate better out- comes than unilateral policy changes, by trading off potential short-term costs of immigration for long- term benefits (Caliendo and others 2021, 2023). 15 In addition to modeling changes in the overall flow of migrants and refugees between economies—allowing for both deflection and deterrence—the model’s frame- work distinguishes between the different legal pathways 14Relatedly, a gravity framework based on an aggregate assessment of an economy’s migration policies may underestimate the magnitude of spillovers, given that adjustments to migration policies often target flows from specific countries of origin or correlate with policy changes in other destination economies. 15In the first exercise, the targeted migration policies apply to both new and incumbent migrants, that is, they alter both barriers to enter and those to remain. Both exercises use a historical episode as a baseline. 1.

However, overarching recommendations include the following: • Improving integration of migrants and refugees to maximize gains for destination economies. Integration challenges can undermine the benefits of migration and tend to be more severe for refugees than for migrants. Possible explanations include the unex- pected nature and scale of these inflows (relative to local populations), as well as the time it takes to be granted refugee status and refugees’ relatively limited access to local labor markets thereafter: ◦ Emerging market and developing destination economies tend to receive a disproportionate share of refugees, who are more often absorbed into the informal economy. Strengthening incentives to take up formal work—including through well-designed tax and transfer systems and improved access to public health and educa- tion services—can help these economies reap the benefits of these inflows. ◦ More broadly, integration efforts across desti- nation economies require minimizing domestic barriers to occupational mobility. Policies to improve skills matching among, and employ- ment outcomes for, refugees include minimizing administrative delays, which can cause harmful gaps in employment history; providing language training; and improving recognition and trans- ferability of qualifications. Other policies that can further improve labor market flexibility—for natives, migrants, and refugees—include provid- ing access to job search services and investment in education to allow for upskilling and (re)training of new entrants. Such policies allow migrants to fill labor shortages as they arise, including those in youth-intensive activities.20 20Many advanced destination economies already use targeted (skills-based) migration policies—such as the H1B visa program in the United States and points-based systems in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom—to fill short- term shortages in labor markets.

At the same time, migrants are deflected toward bordering economies. ◦ The cumulative economic impact in the short to medium term is a modest lowering of GDP in destination economies, with a small boost to out- put elsewhere because their labor supply increases. ◦ In economies that have received deflected migrants or refugees, increased competition may reduce wages for some workers—notably in the short term—while the incomes of natives engaged in activities complementary to the skills of incom- ing migrants and refugees increase.\nCHAPTER 3 JOURNEyS AND JUNCTIONS: SPILLO vERS FROM MIgRATION AND REFUgEE POLICIES 79International Monetary Fund | April 2025 to be more responsive to changes in labor market conditions arising from both cyclical factors and structural changes—such as demographic and sec- toral shifts.5 • Migrants and refugees—who tend to have signifi- cantly lower age profiles than the native population (April 2020 World Economic Outlook [WEO], Chap- ter 4; Box 3.2)—can generate economic gains that outweigh fiscal costs and even ease fiscal pressures if they are well integrated into the labor force (Clem- ens 2024; Box 3.3; see also the April 2025 WEO, Chapter 2). • Furthermore, migrants and refugees may help con- tain (wage push) inflationary pressures by increas- ing the labor supply, as observed across multiple sectors in advanced economies since the pandemic (Cheremukhin and others 2024). These effects can be more pronounced where native workers have skill levels similar to those of migrants and refugees. 5There is evidence that immigrants are more responsive to labor shortages than natives, which reflects, in part, the fact that they have already incurred labor mobility costs. See Online Annex 3.2 for more details. However, migrants can also contribute to infla- tionary pressures by raising demand (Manacorda, Manning, and Wadsworth 2012; April 2020 WEO, Chapter 4; Box 3.4). • Overall, migration policy frameworks will determine how job vacancies are filled between natives and migrants—the latter tend to mobilize in sectors in which labor demand is high, jobs are hard to fill, and barriers to entry are lower (Figure 3.5; Online Annex 3.2). Meanwhile, refugees frequently struggle to join the labor force or find employment opportunities that fully utilize their skills. The benefits from their contri- butions are larger, notably in the long term, if they are well integrated into the labor market. Evidence indi- cates that the complementarity of migrants and refugee skills with those of natives and the strength of inte- gration policies matter also for emerging market and developing economies (Viseth 2021). However, even in situations in which refugees have a common language and culture, legal and structural barriers mean that they tend to work in the informal sector (Alvarez and others 2022).

To address these challenges, destination economies can:

1. Strengthen incentives for formal work through tax and transfer systems.
2. Improve access to public health and education services.
3. Minimize domestic barriers to occupational mobility.
4. Reduce administrative delays affecting employment history.
5. Provide language training and improve recognition of qualifications.
6. Offer job search services and invest in education for upskilling and retraining.","Integration is typically harder for refugees due to the sudden nature of inflows and limited labor market access.

3,Which programs are covered under the SOSI's social insurance focus?,"[""NOTES TO THE FY 2024 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 142 Note 25. Social Insurance SOSI presents the projected actuarial PV of the estimated future revenue and estimated future expenditures of the Social Security, Medicare, Railroad Retirement, and Black Lung social insurance programs which are administered by the SSA, HHS, RRB, and DOL, respectively. Social Security and Medicare projections are based on current law and the Social Security and Medicare trustees intermediate set of assumptions, except that the projections assume full Social Security and Medicare Part A benefits are paid after fund depletion contrary to current law. See Note 29 —Subsequent Events for additional information on the Social Security Fairness Act. Contributions consist of: payroll, income, and excise taxes, premiums from, and state transfers on behalf of, participants in Medicare, and miscellaneous reimbursements from the General Fund. Generally, beneficiaries finance the remainder of Parts B and D costs via monthly premiums to these programs. With the introduction of Part D drug coverage, Medicaid is no longer the primary payer of drug costs for full -benefit dually eligible beneficiaries of Medicare and Medicaid. For those beneficiaries, states are subject to a contribution requirement and must pay a portion of their estimated foregone drug costs into the Part D account (referred to as state transfers). By accounting convention, the General Fund transfers are eliminated in the consolidation of the SOSI at the government -wide level. These General Fund transfers that are used to finance Medicare Parts B and D are also shown as eliminations on these calculations. For the FYs 2024 and 202 3, the amounts eliminated totaled $50.2 trillion and $48.5 trillion, respectively. The SOSI also includes projected general revenues that, under current law, would be used to finance the remainder of the expenditures in excess of revenues for Medicare Parts B and D that is reported in the SOSI. Expenditures include benefit payments scheduled under current law and administrative expenses. Once the reserves in the trust funds are depleted, under current law benefits for Social Security and Medicare Part A can be paid only to the extent there are resources from dedicated income sources. Social insurance programs utilize “trust funds” to account for dedicated collections held for later use to accomplish the program’s purpose. Expenditures reflect full benefit payments even after the point at which trust fund asset reserves are projected to be depleted. Refer to the unaudited RSI–Social Insurance section and SSA’s, HHS’s, RRB’s, and DOL’s financial statements for additional information on Social Security, Medicare, Railroad Retirement, and Black Lung program financing. The estimates in the consolidated SOSI of the open group measures are for persons who are participants or eventually will participate in the programs as contributors (workers) or beneficiaries (retired workers, survivors, dependents, and disabled) during the 75 -year projection period. The closed group comprises only current participants which are those who have attained age 15 at the start of the projection period. Actuarial PV of estimated future income (excluding interest) and estimated future expenditures for the Social Security and Medicare social insurance programs are presented for three differen t groups of participants: 1) current participants who have not yet attained eligibility age; 2) current participants who have attained eligibility age; and 3) new entrants, who are expected to become participants in the future. Current participants in the Social Security and Medicare programs are the closed group of taxpayers and/or beneficiaries who are aged at least 15 years at the start of the projection period. Future participants for Social Security and Medicare include those born during the projection period and individuals below age 15 as of January 1 of the valuation year. Railroad Retirement’s future participants are the projected new entrants as of October 1 of the valuation year. The trust fund balances as of the valuation date for the respective programs, including interest earned, are shown in the table below. 20 The PV of estimated future expenditures in\n171 FY 2024 REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) Social Insurance The social insurance programs consisting of Social Security, Medicare, Railroad Retirement, Black Lung, and UI were developed to provide income security and health care coverage to citizens under specific circumstances as a responsibility of the government. Because taxpayers rely on these programs in their long -term planning, social insurance program information should indicate whether the current statutory provisions of the programs can be sustained, and more generally what effect these provisions likely have on the government’s financial condition. The resources needed to run these programs are raised through taxes and fees. Eligibility for benefits depends in part on earnings and time worked by the individuals. Social Security benefits are generally redistributed intentionally toward lower -wage workers (i.e., benefits are progressive). In addition, each social insurance program has a uniform set of eligibility events and schedules that apply to all participants. RSI material is generally drawn from the 2024 Annual Reports of the Boards of Trustees, which represents the official government evaluation of the financial and actuarial status of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds. Unless otherwise noted, all data are for calendar years, all projections are based on current law and the Trustees intermediate set of assumptions. A significant exception is that the projections disregard benefit payment reductions that would result from the projected depletion of the OASDI and HI Trust Funds. Under current law, benefit payments would be reduced to levels that could be covered by incoming tax and premium revenues when the trust fund balances have been depleted. Social Security and Medicare Social Security The OASI and DI Trust Funds were established on January 1, 1940 and August 1, 1956, respectively as separate accounts in Treasury. The OASI fund pays cash retirement benefits to eligible retirees and their eligible dependents and survivors, and the much smaller DI fund pays cash benefits to eligible individuals who are unable to work because of medical conditions and certain family members of such eligible individuals. All financial operations of the OASI and DI Programs are handled through these respective funds. The two funds are often referred to as the combined OASDI Trust Funds or “Social Security.” At the end of calendar year 2023, Social Security benefits were paid to approximately 67 million beneficiaries. The events that trigger benefit payments are quite different however, both trust funds have the same dedicated financing structure: taxes paid by workers, their employers, and individuals with self -employment income, based on work covered by the Social Security Program. Currently, employers and employees each pay 6.2 percent of taxable earnings, and the self - employed pay 12.4 percent of taxable earnings. Payroll taxes are levied on wages and net earnings from self -employment up to a specified maximum annual amount, referred to as maximum taxable earnings ($168,600.00 in 2024), that increases each year with economy-wide average wages. Legislation passed in 1984 subjected up to half of Social Security benefits to income tax and allocated the revenue to the OASDI Trust Funds. In 1993 legislation increased the potentially taxed portion of benefits to 85.0 percent and allocated the additional revenue to the Medicare’s HI Trust Fund. Medicare The Medicare Program, created in 1965, has two separate trust funds: the HI Trust Fund (otherwise known as Medicare Part A) and the SMI Trust Funds (which consists of the Medicare Part B and Part D 9 accounts). HI helps pay for inpatient hospital skilled nursing facility, home health, and hospice. SMI helps pay for hospital outpatient services, physician servic es, and assorted other services and products through Part B and for prescription drugs through Part D. Though the events that trigger benefit payments are similar, HI and SMI have different dedicated financing structures. Similar to Social Security, HI is financed primarily by payroll contributions. Currently, employers and employees each pay 1.45 percent of earnings, while self -employed workers pay 2.9 percent of their net earnings. SMI is\nAmounts reported in t he SOSI and in the RSI section in this Financial Report are based on each program’s official actuarial calculations. This year’s projections for Social Security and Medicare are based on the same economic and demographic assumptions that underlie the 2024 Social Security and Medicare Trustees Reports and the 2024 SOSI, while comparative information presented from last year’s report is based on the 2023 Social Security and Medicare Trustees Reports and the 2023 SOSI. Table 7 summarizes amounts reported in the SOSI, showing that net social insurance expenditures are projected to be $78.3 trillion over 75 years as of January 1, 2024 for the open group, remaining largely unchanged, decreasing by approximately $100.0 billion compared to net expenditures of $78.4 trillion projected in the FY 2023 Financial Report . 25 24 The Black Lung Benefits Act provides for monthly payments and medical benefits to coal miners totally disabled from pneumoconiosis (black lung disease) arising from their employment in or around the nation's coal mines. See RRB’s projections are based on economic and demographic assumptions that underlie the 29th Actuarial Valuation of the Assets and Liabilities Under the Railroad Retirement Acts as of December 31, 20 22 with Technical Supplement, which also serves as the Annual Report for 2024 , and the 2023 Annual Report on the Railroad Retirement System required by Section 502 of the Railroad Retirement Solvency Act of 1983 (P.L. 98-76). 25 Closed group and open group differ by the population included in each calculation. From the SOSI, the closed group includes: 1) participants who have attained eligibility; and 2) participants who have not attained eligibility. The open group adds future participants to the closed group.

Liabilities also include environmental and disposal liabilities, benefits due and payable, as well as insur ance and guarantee program liabilities. As with reported assets, the government’s responsibilities, policy commitments, and contingencies are much broader than these reported Balance Sheet liabilities. They include the social insurance programs reported in the SOSI and disclosed in the unaudited RSI—Social Insurance section, fiscal long -term projections of non- interest spending reported in the SLTFP, and a wide range of other programs under which the government provides benefits and services to the people of this nation, as well as certain future loss contingencies. The government has entered into contractual commitments requiring the future use of financial resources and has unresolved contingencies where existing conditions, situations, or circumstances create uncertainty about future losses. Commitments and contingencies that do not meet the criteria for recognition as liabilities on the Balance Sheets, but for which there is at least a reasonable possibility that losses have been incurred, are disclosed in Note 20 —Commitments and Note 21—Contingencies. The collection of certain taxes and other revenue is credited to the corresponding funds from dedicated collections that will use these funds to meet a particular government purpose. If the collections from taxes and other sources exceed the payments to the beneficiaries, the excess revenue is invested in Treasury securities or deposited in the General Fund; therefore, the trust fund balances do not represent cash. An explanation of the trust funds for social insurance is included in Note 22—Funds from Dedicated Collections. That note also contains information about trust fund receipts, disbursements, and assets. Due to its sovereign power to tax and borrow, and the country’s wide economic base, the government has unique access to financial resources through generating tax revenues and issuing federal debt securities. This provides the government with the ability to meet present obligations and those that are anticipated from future operations and are not reflected in net position. The net position is the residual difference between assets and liabilities and is the cumulative results of operations since inception. For detailed components that comprise the net position, refer to the section “Statement of Operations and Changes in Net Position.” SUSTAINABILITY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The sustainability financial statements are comprised of the SLTFP, covering all federal government programs, and the SOSI and the SCSIA, covering social insurance programs (Social Security, Medicare, Railroad Retirement, and Black Lung programs). The sustainability financial statements are designed to illustrate the relationship between projected receipts and expenditures if current policy is continued over a 75 -year time horizon. 1 In preparing the sustainability financial statements, management selects assumptions and data that it believes provide a reasonable basis to illustrate whether current policy is sustainable. Current policy is based on current law but includes several adjustments. In the SLTFP, notable adjustments to current law are: 1) projected spending, receipts, and borrowing levels assume raising or suspending the current statutory lim it on federal debt; 2) continued discretionary appropriations are assumed throughout the projections period; 3) scheduled Social Security and Medicare Part A benefit payments are assumed to occur beyond the projected point of trust fund depletion; and 4) many mandatory programs with expiration dates prior to the end of the 75- year projection period are assumed to be reauthorized. In the SOSI, the one adjustment to current law is that scheduled Social Security and Medicare Part A benefit payments are assumed to occur beyond the projected point of trust fund depletions. Assumptions underlying such sustainability information do not consider changes in policy or all potential future events that could affect future income, future expenditures, and, hence, sustainability. The projections do not reflect any adverse economic consequences resulting from continuously rising debt levels. A large number of factors affect the sustainability financial statements and future eve nts and circumstances cannot be estimated with certainty. Therefore, even if current policy is continued, there will be differenc es between the estimates in the\nNOTES TO THE FY 2024 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 146 The Boards of Trustees 21 of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds provide in their annual reports to Congress short-range (10-year) and long- range (75-year) actuarial estimates of each trust fund. Significant uncertainty surrounds the estimates, especially for a period as long as 75 years. To illustrate the range of uncertainty, the Trustees use three altern ative scenarios (low -cost, intermediate, and high -cost) that use specific assumptions. These assumptions include fertility rates, rates of change in mortality, LPR and other than LPR immigration levels, emigration levels, changes in real GDP, changes in the CPI, changes in average real wages, unemployment rates, trust fund real yield rates, and disability incidence and recover y rates. The assumptions used for the most recent set of projections shown above in the Social Security and Medicare demographic and economic assumption table are generally referred to as the “intermediate assumptions,” and reflect the Trustees reasonable estimate of expected future experience. For additional information on Social Security and Medicare demographic and economic assumptions, refer to SSA’s and HHS’s financial statement s. The RRB’s estimated future revenues and expenditures reflected in the SOSI are based on various economic, employment, and other actuarial assumptions, and assume that the program will continue as presently constructed. For further details on actuarial assumptions related to the program and how these assumptions affect amounts presented on the SOSI and SCSIA, consult the Technical Supplement to the 29th Actuarial Valuation of the Assets and Liabilities Under the Railroad Retirement Acts as of December 31, 2022 with Technical Supplement, which also serves as t he 2024 Annual Report of the Railroad Retirement System required by Section 502 of the Railroad Retirement Solvency Act of 1983 (P.L. 98 -76), and RRB’s financial statements. The B LDBP significant assumptions used in the projections are the coal excise tax revenue estimates, the tax rate structure, the number of beneficiaries, life expectancy, federal civilian pay raises, medical cost inflation, and the interest rates used to discount future cash flows. Statement of Changes in Social Insurance Amounts The SCSIA reconciles the change (between the current valuation and the prior valuation) in the PV of estimated future revenue less estimated future expenditures for current and future participants (the open group measure) over the next 75 year s (except Black Lung which has a rolling 25- year projection period). The reconciliation identifies several components of the changes that are significant and provides reasons for the changes. The following disclosures relate to the SCSIA including the reasons for the components of the changes in the open group measure during the reporting period from the end of the previous reporting period for the government’s social insurance programs. All estimates relating to the Social Security and Medicare Programs in the SCSIA represent values that are incremental to the prior change. In general, a decrease in the PV of future net cash outflows represents a positive change (improving financing), while a n increase in the PV of future net cash out flows represents a negative change (worsening financing). For additional information regarding the estimates used to prepare the SCSIA, see SSA’s, HHS’s, RRB’s, and DOL’s financial statements. Assumptions Used for the Components of the Changes The PV included in the SCSIA are for the current and prior years and are based on various economic as well as demographic assumptions used for the intermediate assumptions in the Social Security and Medicare Trustees Report for these years. The Social Security and Medicare – Demographic and Economic Assumptions table summarizes these assumptions for the current year. This year’s SOSI projections for Social Security and Medicare, which are as of January 1, 2024, are based on the same demographic and economic assumptions that underlie the 2024 Social Security and Medicare Trustees Report.""]","The programs covered under the SOSI's social insurance focus are Social Security, Medicare, Railroad Retirement, and Black Lung.","Social Security, Medicare, Railroad Retirement, and Black Lung are covered under SOSI's social insurance programs.",1.0,0.9988356444314344,0.9999999999,1.0

Liabilities also include environmental and disposal liabilities, benefits due and payable, as well as insur ance and guarantee program liabilities. As with reported assets, the government’s responsibilities, policy commitments, and contingencies are much broader than these reported Balance Sheet liabilities. They include the social insurance programs reported in the SOSI and disclosed in the unaudited RSI—Social Insurance section, fiscal long -term projections of non- interest spending reported in the SLTFP, and a wide range of other programs under which the government provides benefits and services to the people of this nation, as well as certain future loss contingencies. The government has entered into contractual commitments requiring the future use of financial resources and has unresolved contingencies where existing conditions, situations, or circumstances create uncertainty about future losses. Commitments and contingencies that do not meet the criteria for recognition as liabilities on the Balance Sheets, but for which there is at least a reasonable possibility that losses have been incurred, are disclosed in Note 20 —Commitments and Note 21—Contingencies. The collection of certain taxes and other revenue is credited to the corresponding funds from dedicated collections that will use these funds to meet a particular government purpose. If the collections from taxes and other sources exceed the payments to the beneficiaries, the excess revenue is invested in Treasury securities or deposited in the General Fund; therefore, the trust fund balances do not represent cash. An explanation of the trust funds for social insurance is included in Note 22—Funds from Dedicated Collections. That note also contains information about trust fund receipts, disbursements, and assets. Due to its sovereign power to tax and borrow, and the country’s wide economic base, the government has unique access to financial resources through generating tax revenues and issuing federal debt securities. This provides the government with the ability to meet present obligations and those that are anticipated from future operations and are not reflected in net position. The net position is the residual difference between assets and liabilities and is the cumulative results of operations since inception. For detailed components that comprise the net position, refer to the section “Statement of Operations and Changes in Net Position.” SUSTAINABILITY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The sustainability financial statements are comprised of the SLTFP, covering all federal government programs, and the SOSI and the SCSIA, covering social insurance programs (Social Security, Medicare, Railroad Retirement, and Black Lung programs). The sustainability financial statements are designed to illustrate the relationship between projected receipts and expenditures if current policy is continued over a 75 -year time horizon. 1 In preparing the sustainability financial statements, management selects assumptions and data that it believes provide a reasonable basis to illustrate whether current policy is sustainable. Current policy is based on current law but includes several adjustments. In the SLTFP, notable adjustments to current law are: 1) projected spending, receipts, and borrowing levels assume raising or suspending the current statutory lim it on federal debt; 2) continued discretionary appropriations are assumed throughout the projections period; 3) scheduled Social Security and Medicare Part A benefit payments are assumed to occur beyond the projected point of trust fund depletion; and 4) many mandatory programs with expiration dates prior to the end of the 75- year projection period are assumed to be reauthorized. In the SOSI, the one adjustment to current law is that scheduled Social Security and Medicare Part A benefit payments are assumed to occur beyond the projected point of trust fund depletions. Assumptions underlying such sustainability information do not consider changes in policy or all potential future events that could affect future income, future expenditures, and, hence, sustainability. The projections do not reflect any adverse economic consequences resulting from continuously rising debt levels. A large number of factors affect the sustainability financial statements and future eve nts and circumstances cannot be estimated with certainty. Therefore, even if current policy is continued, there will be differenc es between the estimates in the\nNOTES TO THE FY 2024 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 146 The Boards of Trustees 21 of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds provide in their annual reports to Congress short-range (10-year) and long- range (75-year) actuarial estimates of each trust fund. Significant uncertainty surrounds the estimates, especially for a period as long as 75 years. To illustrate the range of uncertainty, the Trustees use three altern ative scenarios (low -cost, intermediate, and high -cost) that use specific assumptions. These assumptions include fertility rates, rates of change in mortality, LPR and other than LPR immigration levels, emigration levels, changes in real GDP, changes in the CPI, changes in average real wages, unemployment rates, trust fund real yield rates, and disability incidence and recover y rates. The assumptions used for the most recent set of projections shown above in the Social Security and Medicare demographic and economic assumption table are generally referred to as the “intermediate assumptions,” and reflect the Trustees reasonable estimate of expected future experience. For additional information on Social Security and Medicare demographic and economic assumptions, refer to SSA’s and HHS’s financial statement s. The RRB’s estimated future revenues and expenditures reflected in the SOSI are based on various economic, employment, and other actuarial assumptions, and assume that the program will continue as presently constructed. For further details on actuarial assumptions related to the program and how these assumptions affect amounts presented on the SOSI and SCSIA, consult the Technical Supplement to the 29th Actuarial Valuation of the Assets and Liabilities Under the Railroad Retirement Acts as of December 31, 2022 with Technical Supplement, which also serves as t he 2024 Annual Report of the Railroad Retirement System required by Section 502 of the Railroad Retirement Solvency Act of 1983 (P.L. 98 -76), and RRB’s financial statements. The B LDBP significant assumptions used in the projections are the coal excise tax revenue estimates, the tax rate structure, the number of beneficiaries, life expectancy, federal civilian pay raises, medical cost inflation, and the interest rates used to discount future cash flows. Statement of Changes in Social Insurance Amounts The SCSIA reconciles the change (between the current valuation and the prior valuation) in the PV of estimated future revenue less estimated future expenditures for current and future participants (the open group measure) over the next 75 year s (except Black Lung which has a rolling 25- year projection period). The reconciliation identifies several components of the changes that are significant and provides reasons for the changes. The following disclosures relate to the SCSIA including the reasons for the components of the changes in the open group measure during the reporting period from the end of the previous reporting period for the government’s social insurance programs. All estimates relating to the Social Security and Medicare Programs in the SCSIA represent values that are incremental to the prior change. In general, a decrease in the PV of future net cash outflows represents a positive change (improving financing), while a n increase in the PV of future net cash out flows represents a negative change (worsening financing). For additional information regarding the estimates used to prepare the SCSIA, see SSA’s, HHS’s, RRB’s, and DOL’s financial statements. Assumptions Used for the Components of the Changes The PV included in the SCSIA are for the current and prior years and are based on various economic as well as demographic assumptions used for the intermediate assumptions in the Social Security and Medicare Trustees Report for these years. The Social Security and Medicare – Demographic and Economic Assumptions table summarizes these assumptions for the current year. This year’s SOSI projections for Social Security and Medicare, which are as of January 1, 2024, are based on the same demographic and economic assumptions that underlie the 2024 Social Security and Medicare Trustees Report.""]","The SOSI reports the following three components for social insurance programs:

5,What components made up the U.S. nuclear complex after World War II?,"['188 | Chapter 5 energy from dammed water into electricity, provided 6 percent of electricity generation in 2023 (EIA 2024d). Hydropower is renewable, and it can be operated to provide stable generation or flexibly to complement wind and solar (DOE 2024c). While its potential to scale up is limited by natural resources (Fendt and Parsons 2021), the DOE estimates that significant new hydropower generation could be added by 2050 through upgrades to existing plants, adding capacity at existing dams and canals, and limited develop - ment of new stream-reaches, in addition to the potential for new pumped storage capacity already discussed (DOE 2024c). Nuclear energy provides roughly 20 percent of current electricity gen- eration in the United States. Nuclear plants have high fixed costs and low variable costs, making them well-suited for stable production. Most U.S. nuclear plants are large light-water reactors, which can offer low marginal costs per megawatt-hour due to economies of scale (DOE 2024d). In addi- tion, investments in small modular reactors (SMRs), which have a smaller geographic footprint than traditional reactors and can be partially prefabri - cated offsite, can potentially allow for faster, cheaper construction in areas unsuitable for standard nuclear facilities. While SMRs may cost more per megawatt-hour than large reactors, they may be more suitable for replacing smaller retiring coal plants or industrial processes requiring high heat, and they may be more attainable for investors with limited land, labor, and capi- tal (DOE 2024d). Recent technological advancements have improved their suitability for flexible production as well (Renteria, Schwartz, and Jenkins 2024), implying that nuclear could be used as a replacement for natural gas plants in complementing variable renewables. Concerns about rare disasters and the challenges of storing nuclear waste have given rise to safety regulations that drive up the cost of nuclear energy (Lovering, Yip, and Nordhaus 2016), likely contributing to the decline in the construction of new plants since the 1980s (Makarin, Qian, and Wang 2024). However, nuclear plants can be safely built and operated at economically viable costs (Ritchie 2020). For example, France opened its first nuclear plant in the 1960s and produces the majority of its electricity using nuclear power today (EIA 2023). Scaling up U.S. nuclear power would require catalyzing private sector investments by streamlining regulation and investing in innovation, demonstration, and deployment (DOE 2024d; White House 2024a). The IRA provides tax credits for nuclear energy production and investment, and the Biden-Harris Administration funds a number of demonstration and research programs, offers low-cost loans for deployment of commercial technologies, and signed the ADVANCE Act to increase licensing efficiency (DOE 2024d).\n111 NOTES TO THE FY 2024 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 14.

The nuclear complex was comprised of nuclear reactors, chemical -processing buildings, metal machining plants, laboratories, and maintenance facilities. At all sites where these activities took place, some environmental contamination occurred. This contamination was caused by the production, storage, and use of radioactive materials and hazardous chemicals, which resulted in contamination of soil, surface water, or groundwater. The environmental legacy of nuclear weapons production also includes thousands of contaminated buildings and large volumes of waste and special nuclear materials requiring treatment, stabilization, and disposal. Estimated cleanup costs at sites for which there are no current feasible remediation approaches are excluded from the estimates, although applicable stewardship and monitoring costs for these sites are included. DOE has not been required through regulation to establish remediation activities for these sites. Estimating DOE’s environmental cleanup liability requires making assumptions about future activities and is inherently uncertain. The future course of DOE’s environmental cleanup and disposal will depend on a number of fundamental technical and policy choices, many of which have not been made. Some contaminated sites and facilities could be restored to a condition suitable for any desired use or could be restored to a point where they pose no near -term health risks to the surrounding communities. Achieving the former condition of the sites and facilities would have a higher cost which may or may not warrant the cost or be legally required. The environmental and disposal liability estimates include contingency estimates intended to account for the uncertainties associated with the technical cleanup scope of the program. Congressional appropriations at lower -than anticipated levels or lack of congressional approval, unplanned delays in project completions, unforeseen technical issues, obtaining regulatory approval, among other things, could cause increases in life -cycle costs. DOE’s environmental and disposal liabilities also include the estimated cleanup and post -closure responsibilities, including surveillance and monitoring activities, soil and groundwater remediation, and disposition of excess material for sites. DOE is responsible for the post -closure activities at many of the closure sites as well as other sites. The costs for these post-closure activities are estimated for a period of 75 years after the balance sheet date, i.e., through 2099 in FY 2024 and through 209 8 in FY 2023. While some post -cleanup monitoring and other long -term stewardship activities post- 2099 are included in the liability, there are others DOE expects to continue beyond 2099 for which the costs cannot reasonably be estimated. A portion of DOE’s environmental liability at various field sites includes anticipated costs for facilities managed by DOE’s ongoing program operations, which will ultimately require stabilization, deactivation, and decommissioning. The estimates are largely based upon a cost -estimating model. Site specific estimates are used in lieu of the cost- estimating model, when available. Cost estimates for ongoing program facilities are updated each year. For facilities newly contaminated since FY 1997, cleanup costs are allocated to the periods benefiting from the operations of the facilities.

The CERCLA, SARA, and RCRA require DOD to clean up contamination in coordination with regulatory entities, current owners of property damaged by DOD, and third parties that have a partial responsibility for the environmental restoration. Failure to comply with agreements and legal mandates puts the DOD at risk of incurring fines and penalties. DOD utilizes an estimating methodology model which includes the use of mathematical equations to con vert resources data into cost data to project environmental cleanup cost. DOD validates the models and estimates liabilities based on data received during preliminary assessment and site investigation. For PP&E placed into service after September 30, 1997, DOD expenses associated environmental cleanup costs using two methods: physical capacity usage of the assets or systematically recognized over the use ful life. DOD expensed cleanup costs for PP&E placed into service before October 1, 1997, unless costs are to be recovered through user charges. As costs are recovered DOD expenses cleanup costs associated with the asset life that has passed since the PP&E was placed into service. DOD systematically recognizes the remaining cost over the remaining life of the asset. The unrecognized portion of the estimated total cleanup costs associated with disposal of PP&E was $ 5.2 billion and $4.7 billion for fiscal years ending September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

Note: ""N/A"" indicates not applicable. Management and legal counsel have determined that it is “probable” that some legal actions, litigation, tort claims, and environmental and disposal contingencies will result in a loss to the government and the loss amounts are reasonably measurable. The estimated liabilities for “probable” cases against the government are $51.9 billion and $55.9 billion as of September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and are included in “Other Liabilities” on the Balance Sheet. An example of a probable contingency that could result in a loss against the government for DOE and HHS is provided below. DOE, in accordance with the NWPA, entered into more than 69 standard contracts with utilities in which, in return for payment of fees into the Nuclear Waste Fund, DOE agreed to begin disposal of SNF by January 31, 1998. Because DOE has no facility available to receive SNF under the NWPA, it has been unable to begin disposal of the utilities’ SNF as required b y the contracts. Significant litigation claiming damages for partial breach of contract has ensued as a result of this delay. B ased on settlement estimates, the estimated total liability as of September 30, 2024 is in a range between $48.7 billion and $55.6 billion. After deducting the cumulative amount paid of $11.1 billion as of September 30, 2024 under these settlements, and as a result of final judgments, the remaining liability is estimated to be in the range of between $37.6 billion and $44.5 billi on. The U.S. Supreme Court 2012 decision in Salazar v. Ramah Navajo Chapter , and subsequent cases related to contract support costs have resulted in increased claims against the Indian Health Service, which is a component within HHS. As a result of this decision, many tribes have filed claims. Some claims have been paid and others have been asserted but not yet settled. It is expected that some tribes will file additional claims for prior years. The estimated amount recorded for contr act support costs is $6.7 billion in FY 2024 and $6.4 billion in FY 2023. There are also administrative claims and legal actions pending where adverse decisions are considered by management and legal counsel as “reasonably possible” with an estimate of potential loss or a range of potential loss. The estimated potential losses reported for such claims and actions range from $23.9 billion to $125.1 billion as of September 30, 2024, and from $10.6 billion to $107.4 billion as of September 30, 2023.

The nuclear complex was comprised of nuclear reactors, chemical -processing buildings, metal machining plants, laboratories, and maintenance facilities. At all sites where these activities took place, some environmental contamination occurred. This contamination was caused by the production, storage, and use of radioactive materials and hazardous chemicals, which resulted in contamination of soil, surface water, or groundwater. The environmental legacy of nuclear weapons production also includes thousands of contaminated buildings and large volumes of waste and special nuclear materials requiring treatment, stabilization, and disposal. Estimated cleanup costs at sites for which there are no current feasible remediation approaches are excluded from the estimates, although applicable stewardship and monitoring costs for these sites are included. DOE has not been required through regulation to establish remediation activities for these sites. Estimating DOE’s environmental cleanup liability requires making assumptions about future activities and is inherently uncertain. The future course of DOE’s environmental cleanup and disposal will depend on a number of fundamental technical and policy choices, many of which have not been made. Some contaminated sites and facilities could be restored to a condition suitable for any desired use or could be restored to a point where they pose no near -term health risks to the surrounding communities. Achieving the former condition of the sites and facilities would have a higher cost which may or may not warrant the cost or be legally required. The environmental and disposal liability estimates include contingency estimates intended to account for the uncertainties associated with the technical cleanup scope of the program. Congressional appropriations at lower -than anticipated levels or lack of congressional approval, unplanned delays in project completions, unforeseen technical issues, obtaining regulatory approval, among other things, could cause increases in life -cycle costs. DOE’s environmental and disposal liabilities also include the estimated cleanup and post -closure responsibilities, including surveillance and monitoring activities, soil and groundwater remediation, and disposition of excess material for sites. DOE is responsible for the post -closure activities at many of the closure sites as well as other sites. The costs for these post-closure activities are estimated for a period of 75 years after the balance sheet date, i.e., through 2099 in FY 2024 and through 209 8 in FY 2023. While some post -cleanup monitoring and other long -term stewardship activities post- 2099 are included in the liability, there are others DOE expects to continue beyond 2099 for which the costs cannot reasonably be estimated. A portion of DOE’s environmental liability at various field sites includes anticipated costs for facilities managed by DOE’s ongoing program operations, which will ultimately require stabilization, deactivation, and decommissioning. The estimates are largely based upon a cost -estimating model. Site specific estimates are used in lieu of the cost- estimating model, when available. Cost estimates for ongoing program facilities are updated each year. For facilities newly contaminated since FY 1997, cleanup costs are allocated to the periods benefiting from the operations of the facilities. Facilities’ cleanup costs allocated to future periods and not included in the environmental and disposal liabilities amounted to $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion for fiscal years ending September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

The CERCLA, SARA, and RCRA require DOD to clean up contamination in coordination with regulatory entities, current owners of property damaged by DOD, and third parties that have a partial responsibility for the environmental restoration. Failure to comply with agreements and legal mandates puts the DOD at risk of incurring fines and penalties. DOD utilizes an estimating methodology model which includes the use of mathematical equations to con vert resources data into cost data to project environmental cleanup cost. DOD validates the models and estimates liabilities based on data received during preliminary assessment and site investigation. For PP&E placed into service after September 30, 1997, DOD expenses associated environmental cleanup costs using two methods: physical capacity usage of the assets or systematically recognized over the use ful life. DOD expensed cleanup costs for PP&E placed into service before October 1, 1997, unless costs are to be recovered through user charges. As costs are recovered DOD expenses cleanup costs associated with the asset life that has passed since the PP&E was placed into service. DOD systematically recognizes the remaining cost over the remaining life of the asset. The unrecognized portion of the estimated total cleanup costs associated with disposal of PP&E was $ 5.2 billion and $4.7 billion for fiscal years ending September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. DOD is responsible for environmental restoration and corrective action for buried chemical munitions and agents; however, a reasonable estimate is indeterminable because the extent of the buried chemical munitions and agents is unknown. DOD has ongoing studies for the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program and will update its estimate as additional information is identified. DOD may incur costs for restoration initiatives in conjunction with returning overseas DOD facilities to host nations. DOD continues its efforts to reasonably estimate required restoration costs. Environmental liabilities change over time because of laws and regulation updates, technology advances, inflation or deflation factors and disposal plan revisions. DOD revised estimates resulting from previously unknown contaminants, reestimation based on different assumptions, and other changes in project scope.
