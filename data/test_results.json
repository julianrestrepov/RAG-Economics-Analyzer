    "question": "What happens to government borrowing costs when its debt-to-GDP ratio gets too high?",

      "supports demand and allows the economy to emerge from recessions more quickly. Debt may also be a cost -effective means of financing capital investment that promotes future economic growth, which may in turn make future debt levels more manageable. However, economic theory also suggests that high levels of debt may contribute to higher interest rates, leading to lower private investment and a smaller capital stock that the economy can use to grow. Unfortunately, it is unclear what debt -to-GDP ratio would be sufficiently high to produce these negative outcomes, or whether the key concern is the level of debt per se, or a trend that shows debt increasing over time. While several empirical studies have attempted to discern a definite relationship between debt and economic growth from the past experience of countries, the evidence is mixed. One study suggested that debt -to-GDP ratios in excess of 90 percent had significant negative consequences for real GDP growth across advanced countries . 5 Real GDP growth is generally lower by about 1 percent when the countries’ debt\n\nr – g and easing fiscal pressures—meaning that, all else equal, a lower primary balance would keep the debt ratio stable. However, labor supply policies could also put upward pressure on interest rates because of lower desired aggregate savings—due, for instance, to longer expected working lives—and increased investment demand to accommodate a larger labor force. 13 The overall effect on r – g would depend on how much these reforms boost growth in individual countries and 13It is also important to acknowledge that government borrow- ing costs may deviate from equilibrium interest rates considered in the model as a result of factors related to the depth of markets for sovereign debt, the international currency status of the country issuing the debt, and increased debt issuance, as well as shifts in safe asset demand or market sentiment regarding fiscal risks. Limited market capacity to absorb large debt issuances may also put upward pressure on government borrowing costs and cause gradual erosion in the “convenience yield” on government debt; see, for example, the\n\nof GDP at the end of FY 2024. This ratio in creased during FY 2024 because debt grew faster than GDP.14,15 From Chart 7, since 1940, the average debt-to-GDP ratio is 51 percent. See Note 29 —Subsequent Events for information about events that occurred after the end of the fiscal year that may affect the government’s financial position and condition. 13 In FY 2023, Treasury faced a delay in raising the debt limit that required it to depart from its normal debt management proce dures and invoke legal authorities to avoid exceeding the statutory debt limit. During this period, extraordinary measures taken by Treasury resulted in federal debt securities not being issued to certain federal government accounts with the securities being restored, including lost interest, to the affec ted government accounts subsequent to the end of the delay period. Due to th e delay in raising the statutory debt limit, Treasury took extraordinary measures from January 19,\n\n1.2 percent by 2030 where it remains through the projection period. The primary deficit -to-GDP projections in Chart 8, projections for interest rates, and projections for GDP together determine the debt-to-GDP ratio projections shown in Chart 9. That ratio was approximately 98 percent at the end of FY 2024 and under current policy is projected to be approximately 100 percent in 2025 , exceed 200 percent by 2049 and reach 535 percent by 2099. The change in debt held by the public from one year to the next generally represents the budget deficit, the difference between total spending and total receipts. The debt -to-GDP ratio rises continually in great part because primary deficits lead to higher levels of debt, which lead to higher net interest expenditures, and higher net interest expenditures lead to higher debt. 22 The continuous rise of the debt -to-GDP ratio indicates that current policy is unsustainable. These debt-to-GDP projections\n\n-to-GDP ratios are above 90 percent relative to the times when they are below 90 percent. 6 However, after removing sample countries with very high indebtedness – those with debt-to-GDP ratios of more than 120 percent – and very low indebtedness – those with debt -to-GDP ratios of less than 30 percent – the negative relationship between growth and debt is difficult to determine. Another study reports that differences in average GDP growth in countries with debt -to-GDP ratios between 30 -60 percent, 60- 90 percent, and 90 -120 percent cannot be statistically distinguished. 7 Some countries with high debt -to-GDP ratios have been observed to experience lower -than- average growth, while other countries with similarly high debt -to-GDP ratios have continued to enjoy robust growth. Analogously, low debt -to-GDP ratios are no guarantee of strong economic growth. Moreover, the direction of causality is 5 Reinhart,"

In contrast, workers with tertiary education are more exposed to AI, with more than 80 percent employed in AI-intensive occu- pations. However, most of those are concentrated in HEHC occupations, poised for productivity and wage gains.2 This suggests that, for a given educational level, older workers may benefit more from AI adoption than younger cohorts, as the former are relatively more concentrated in HEHC occupations. Interestingly, several features of jobs with high AI exposure are aligned with older workers’ prefer- ences. Over the past three decades, there has been a general rise in age-friendly jobs—characterized by less-demanding physical activity, lower levels of job hazards, and moderate work paces (Acemoglu, Mühlbach, and Scott 2022). Such features are attrac- tive for older workers and align with the positive gains in their cognitive capacities amid healthy aging docu-\n\nCHAPTER 2 ThE RISE OF ThE SIL vER ECONOMy: GLObAL IMPLICATIONS OF POPULATION A GING 69International Monetary Fund | April 2025 Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping labor markets, transforming the way individuals work, communicate, and solve complex problems. Although recent advances in AI technology hold great potential to boost productivity by assisting workers and enabling them to focus more on complex and high-value tasks, they also pose risks by rendering certain skills obsolete, thereby increasing the risk of unemployment. Older workers (ages 55 and older) are particularly vulnerable, as historical evidence suggests that they are less likely to adapt to new technologies and transition to new occupations (Autor and Dorn 2009). Without ade- quate policy interventions, disruptions resulting from the realization of these risks may lead to reduced labor market participation, lower numbers of working hours, transitions to less suitable roles, premature workforce withdrawal, or any combination of these outcomes— further exacerbating\n\nlabor market pressures in aging economies. However, if older workers are concentrated in occupations expected to expand and experience productivity gains as a result of AI, they may be well positioned to benefit from AI advancements, as long as they are able to use new technologies. T o measure the initial impact of AI on labor markets in a context of aging populations, this box examines both AI exposure and its potential to com- plement older workers. Occupations can be grouped into three categories: those at high risk of labor substitution (high exposure and low complementarity, or HELC), those likely to experience productivity and wage boosts (high exposure and high complementarity, or HEHC), and those less affected by AI adoption (low exposure).1 Regardless of demographic shifts, The authors of this box are Andresa H.

Despite these challenges, older workers are already more represented in occupations poised to benefit from AI than in those at risk from it. These findings suggest that improving job conditions— particularly through stress management, remote work options, and flexibility—could help retain older work- ers in AI-enhanced roles. Targeted policies remain necessary for older workers in HELC occupations. Across different education levels, 20–30 percent of older workers are employed in HELC jobs vulnerable to AI-driven disruptions. This group is particularly at risk, as historical data suggest older workers are less likely to switch jobs or occu- pations (Figure 2.3.3). As labor demand for HELC occupations declines, the ability of these workers to relocate to growing\n\n(Felten, Raj, and Seamans 2021), whereas the degree of complementarity measures how likely AI is to augment workers in certain occupations (Pizzinelli and others 2023). The complementary measure incorporates broader occupational factors that influence the likelihood of benefiting from AI adoption; see Pizzinelli and others (2023) for details. ongoing labor market trends indicate that occupations vulnerable to automation are already losing ground to those involving AI-enhanced roles. For instance, in the United States, vacancies in HELC occupations have expanded at a slower pace in locations with greater AI adoption, whereas HEHC job vacancies have remained stable or even increased slightly in these areas (Pizzi- nelli and others 2023). The likely impact of AI on older workers, in a manner similar to that in which it operates on younger cohorts, will depend largely on their levels of education (Figure 2.3.1).

The remaining half of tariﬀ revenues are redistributed to households.[←] 33\n\nAssumptions common to all three scenarios Tariﬀs are assumed to be permanent and to reduce TFP and investment. In Canada, half of the revenues from tariﬀs are remitted to businesses aﬀected by tariﬀs in line with Government of Canada announcements. Remaining tariﬀ revenues are redistributed to households. In all other countries, half of the revenues from tariﬀs are redistributed to households, while the rest is added to general revenues. In most countries, three-quarters of the increased costs from tariﬀs are passed through to consumer prices within six quarters. In the United States, tariﬀs are assumed to pass through to goods prices in roughly three quarters. The United States is the only country to impose tariﬀs on all its trading partners, increasing the cost of imports from all countries. Therefore, businesses do not need to worry about cheaper substitutes and can pass on tariﬀ-related cost increases more quickly. The scenarios\n\n1, executive orders signed by US President Donald J.

There are already some signs that tariffs have begun to be passed through into consumer prices, notably durable goods with a high import content (Figure 4, Panel C). Recent business surveys also suggest that continued increases in manufacturing input prices in the United States are being passed through to output prices . There are few indications from import price data that foreign companies have sought to offset higher US tariffs in the prices of exports to the United States, with one notable exception being the lower price of passenger car exports from Japan.\n\nExchange rate movements are considerably smaller if tariff increases are perceived as temporary, about one-third the size relative to the version of the model in which tariffs are perceived as permanent. Inflation. The impact on inflation is uncertain (Figure 1.2.1, panel 2). In the first version, the effect is limited, except in China, which experiences a decrease of about 60 basis points in 2026 because of the man- aged exchange rate. Inflationary effects in the United States are offset by the appreciation of the dollar and some decline in markups. When tariffs are perceived to be temporary and import costs are fully passed on, US inflation increases by close to 50 basis points in 2025. The impact on inflation outside the United States is instead larger if the dollar plays a central role in the pricing of global trade, as the appreciation of the dollar raises production costs globally.

While inﬂation is close to 2%, underlying inﬂation has risen to about 2½%. The trade conﬂict disrupted the Canadian economy in the ﬁrst half of 2025. In the ﬁrst quarter, trade was pulled forward in anticipation of tariﬀs, and exports grew rapidly. As a result, Canada’s gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 2.2%. At the same time, growth in ﬁnal domestic demand stalled as uncertainty about the trade environment began to weigh on business and household spending. The impact of tariﬀs on economic activity continued to play out in the second quarter; GDP is estimated to have fallen by 1.5%. Exports fell because trade activity brought forward in the two previous quarters was reversed and tariﬀs were imposed.

If the trade conﬂict were to escalate or de- escalate, those shifts would alter economic outcomes.

It has negotiated agreements with some countries, but many others still face threats of signiﬁcant new tariﬀs. These policy shifts have happened quickly and sometimes without warning. As a result, this Report presents a current tariﬀ scenario instead of a base-case projection as well as two alternative scenarios—a de-escalation scenario and an escalation scenario.

Compared with the current tariﬀ scenario: economic growth in Canada slows markedly, with gross domestic product (GDP) about 1.25% lower by the end of the scenario horizon inﬂation rises faster, because of the increase in tariﬀs, to around 2.5% in 2026, before stabilizing around 2% in 2027 De-escalation scenario In this scenario, the United States lowers its tariﬀs against Canada and other countries.

First, the doubling of U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%, and newly added tariffs on copper of 50% has prompted further downgrades of our 2025 growth forecasts for: Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba. Second, heightened duties on lumber exports—which are compounding existing challenges of investment weakness—implies a lower growth projection for British Columbia as well. Third, while all eyes are on U.S. tariffs, Chinese tariffs are also in play. Seafood tariffs had already been incorporated into earlier projections, and therefore haven’t altered the better-than-national average growth outlook for Atlantic provinces.

On the upside, any agreements that lower bilateral tariff barriers from current levels and improve confidence would support stronger economic growth and trade and lower inflation relative to the baseline. 19. Inflation could be higher than currently projected. Food price inflation could continue to move higher and any additional increase in geopolitical tensions in oil-producing regions could threaten global energy supply, pushing up energy prices . Given the salience of food and energy prices for household consumption baskets, higher price rises for these items could raise short-term inflation expectations and result in policy interest rates being higher than would otherwise have been the case. Such a scenario could also adversely affect consumer confidence, further weakening growth. An additional concern, particularly in the United States, is that the pass-through of tariffs into prices could strengthen more quickly than anticipated once companies exhaust the scope to absorb higher costs in their profit margins. This may increase the risk of second-round effects and greater inflation persistence. 20. Fiscal vulnerabilities could increasingly attract attention, tightening financial conditions and adversely impacting\n\ntheir prices. Inﬂation expectations could drift higher, especially given the recent experience of high inﬂation. Consumers and businesses aﬀected by tariﬀ-related price increases may begin to expect that prices will rise persistently at an elevated pace. This expectation could feed through to wage demands and costs and could inﬂuence how businesses set their prices. These risks would likely be ampliﬁed in the escalation scenario. Geopolitical tensions could increase costs Ongoing geopolitical tensions could lead to unexpected upward pressure on costs. For example, oil prices could rise sharply if tensions in the Middle East increased or Russia’s war on Ukraine escalated again. This would drive up fuel prices and cause inﬂation to rise.

A trade war could also fuel inflationary pressures, primarily through rising import prices (Fajgelbaum and Khandelwal 2022). Although the simulations in Box 1.1 indicate rather moderate effects, several factors could lead to higher inflationary pressures in some countries. First, with more than 80 percent of trade invoicing in US dollars, additional pressure may arise if the US dollar appreciates, as observed during previous episodes of trade uncertainty and financial market volatility. Second, inflation expectations are currently higher than central bank targets and, in some cases, on the rise.

These cost pressures are particularly diﬃcult to assess, and there is a risk that they will be more signiﬁcant than anticipated.

This could arise because: global economic activity is weaker US tariﬀs on Canadian goods have a bigger impact than expected In addition, the weakness in the export sector could spread to the rest of the Canadian economy by more than expected. With unemployment already at elevated levels and households uncertain about their economic future, spending on housing and other major purchases could be meaningfully softer. This impact could be ampliﬁed by the recent weakness in some regional housing markets. Greater excess supply in the Canadian economy would create more downward pressure on inﬂation.

If growth is declining or labor markets are softening while inflationary pressures and inflation expectations are clearly returning toward target, maintaining a constant level of nominal policy rates will, over time, result in a restrictive real policy stance as inflation declines while growth weakens. In these circumstances, gradual reductions in the policy rate to move the policy stance closer to the neutral rate are appropriate.

Where near-term inflation risks are tilted to the upside or inflation expectations are rising, future cuts to the policy rate should remain contingent on evidence that inflation is heading decisively back toward target. This can ensure inflation expectations remain anchored while guarding against the risk of premature monetary policy easing followed by later rate hikes.

Third, beyond chronological age, physiological aging also influences individuals’ labor supply and retirement decisions. In line with findings in the previous section, research suggests that physiological functioning is a key predictor of individuals’ labor force participation and productivity, independent of their chronological age (Kotschy, Bloom, and Scott 2024). Improvements in how individuals age can thus affect education, work, and saving decisions, with broad implications for aggre- gate labor supply, interest rates, and economic growth.

Similarly, labor may gradually migrate from younger, labor-abundant economies to older economies facing labor scarcity. The Model This chapter employs\n\n29 advanced and 12 emerging market economies over 2000–22 to establish the extent of healthy-aging trends and their association with labor market outcomes. It then employs a multicountry, overlapping-generations general equilibrium model cov- ering 69 economies—representing about two-thirds of global output and the world’s population—to assess the economic implications of global aging through the end of the century. After baseline projections under current policies are established, the model is used to assess the potential impact of targeted progrowth policies to cush- ion against the growth and fiscal implications of aging. The chapter’s main findings are as follows: • Economies worldwide are aging rapidly as a result of declining fertility and rising life expectancy, with the pace of aging varying significantly across regions.

Shrinking labor supply can contribute to higher capital-to-labor ratios, reducing the need for further investment, which puts downward pressure on interest rates. Meanwhile, aging carries several fiscal challenges: Pension (and health) spending can climb when the number of retirees rises, whereas a shrinking labor force might imply lower consumption and labor income tax revenues. As a result, aging can push the public-debt-to-GDP ratio upward. The analysis considers three instruments for reform- ing pension plans.

The chapter benefited from comments by Andrew Scott and internal seminar participants and reviewers. Population aging has often been linked to gloomy prospects for economic growth and public finances. The fall in the proportion of working-age individuals may depress labor supply and output growth (Gagnon, Johannsen, and López-Salido 2021; Maestas, Mullen, and Powell 2023). Slower population growth can also lead to fewer ideas and less innovation, and thus slower productivity growth (Aksoy and others 2019; Jones 2022). A higher dependency ratio, wherein fewer workers support more retirees, can strain public pension systems and increase health care spending (Lee 2016). However, individuals are not only living for longer but generally also aging in better health (Scott 2021, 2023; Kotschy and Bloom 2023).

Nevertheless, population aging, together with other forces such as waning catch-up growth in large emerging market economies, is expected to depress global economic growth. Even as ongoing gains from healthy aging are estimated to boost annual global growth by about 0.4 percentage point over 2025–50, the analysis in this chapter indicates that under current policies global output growth would decline on average by about 2 percentage points through the end of the century.

Among advanced economies, the median effective retirement age is about 2.5 years lower than the statutory retirement age. However, it varies widely across countries and over time, likely reflecting adjustments to the statutory retirement age, the generosity of pensions, and differences in health status among older workers. At the same time, a shrinking workforce increases capital per worker, reducing investment needs. These forces combine and, on balance, tend to place down- ward pressure on interest rates (Gagnon, Johannsen, and López-Salido 2021; April 2023 World Economic Outlook [WEO], Chapter 2). 6 The uneven pace of these trends across economies due to aging will largely shape their net foreign asset positions (Auclert and others 2024).

Given individuals’ typical life cycle—birth, schooling, working, and retirement— chronological age thresholds defining economic activity and retirement relative to life expectancy play a critical role.

These pressures intensify as the lifespan beyond retirement age lengthens.5 Second, the expected length of working lives relative to retirement influences individuals’ saving behavior. If life expectancy increases while the effective retirement age remains unchanged, individuals tend to save more to smooth consumption over their lives, driving up aggregate savings. Moreover, if the within-economy age profiles of wealth\n\nCHAPTER 2 ThE RISE OF ThE SIL vER ECONOMy: GLObAL IMPLICATIONS OF POPULATION A GING 51International Monetary Fund | April 2025 of older individuals with higher accumulated savings in large economies, is projected to exert downward pressure on interest rates.

For instance, the impact of better health on labor force participation of individuals in their 50s is significantly larger than that for individuals in their 60s and 70s (Online Annex Figure 2.2.6). This suggests that even if the functional capacity of older individuals improves, other factors—such as skills obsolescence, pension incentives, and age discrimination—can still constrain their attachment to the labor market (Neumark, Burn, and Button 2019; D’Albis 2023). However, evidence 4Qualitatively similar results are obtained when using an aug- mented inverse-probability-weighting approach, in which\n\nImportantly, healthy life expectancy has increased at a similar pace, with additional years largely free from chronic illnesses. Recent studies have documented significant improvements in the physical and cognitive abilities of individuals over the age of 50 in some advanced economies, though with notable heterogeneity across socioeconomic groups (Freedman and others 2013; Abeliansky and Strulik 2019; Old and Scott 2023). Healthier aging could thus continue to boost labor supply by extending working lives and enhancing older workers’ productivity, offering a bright spot amid the rise of the silver economy. Against this backdrop, this chapter pursues the following intertwined objectives: (1) assessing the extent to which cohorts are aging in better health and its impact on labor market outcomes, (2) evaluating the global economic implications of demographic shifts and healthy-aging trends, and (3) exploring how targeted policies can help mitigate the negative effects of population aging. T o achieve these objectives, the chapter seeks to answer the following questions:\n\npeople not only are living longer but are also aging in better health, which is associated with longer and more productive working lives. Alongside increases in longevity, the functional capacity of older individuals has improved over time. More recent cohorts of older individuals are physically stronger and cognitively abler than earlier cohorts at the same age. Notably, when cognitive capacities are the focus, “the 70s are the new 50s”: Data from a sample of 41 advanced and emerging market econo- mies indicate that, on average, a person who was 70 in 2022 had the same cognitive ability as a 53-year- old in 2000. Over the course of a decade, this pace of improvement in cognitive abilities is associated with an increase of approximately 20 percentage points in the likelihood that individuals remain engaged in the labor market, either by working or actively seeking employment, along with an increase of about six hours in average weekly hours worked and a 30 percent rise in labor\n\nthis century. And the window for low-income countries to reap demo- graphic dividends is gradually closing. Healthy Aging and Implications for Labor Markets Because longevity is a key driver of changes in the age structure of economies, an important question is whether individuals are aging in better health. Is there evidence that the functional ability of older individuals has been increasing over time? How broad-based are these gains across different economies? And what are the implications for labor markets? T o tackle these questions, this section uses micro- data from surveys of individuals ages 50 and above,\n\nreducing early retirement benefits, introducing incentives to postpone retirement, and allowing for phased retirement can induce a rise in effective retire- ment age. Pension system reforms need to balance sustainability with adequate protection to mitigate old-age poverty and inequality (Amaglobeli and others 2019). More broadly, the malleability of aging and the diversity in health status and experience among older workers suggest that age-based provisions in policies are likely to be inefficient and should be reconsidered (see discussion in Scott 2023). Also, lifelong upskilling and reskilling programs are crucial to ensure individ- uals remain employable as they age. This becomes even more important at the cusp of a potential AI revolution, in which skilled older workers will be well positioned to reap the benefits given the complemen- tarity of their skills with AI, whereas unskilled workers may struggle to keep their jobs or manage successful job transitions (Box 2.3).

Although these trends are encouraging, another important question is how broad-based these healthy-aging gains have been across countries and socioeconomic groups. A simple inspection of life expectancy across countries does point to some global convergence in longevity. First, average life expectancy across countries has been gradually catching up to the life expectancy frontier (Figure 2.4, panel 1; note that setbacks in the 1960s and 2020s shown in the figure were due to global pandemics). For instance, Japan, Korea, and Singapore—among the countries with the highest longevities today—had very different life expectancies in the 1950s.

Uneven Pace of Global Population Aging Advancements in health care, public health mea- sures, and improvements in living standards in past decades have contributed to significant declines in mortality rates across the world. Lower mortality rates in middle and old age have resulted in significant increases in life expectancy and longevity. These trends, together with falling birth rates, are leading to signifi- cant changes in the age structure of economies.

The model tracks the macroeconomic and fiscal implications of aging and fiscal policy separately for two gener- ations: the young, who work (or are unemployed) and pay consumption and labor income taxes (or receive unemployment benefits), and the old, who are retired and receive pension benefits. Population aging causes the labor force to shrink (in relative or absolute terms), which, in turn, drags down the growth rates of consumption, investment, and output. 2 Aggregate consumption and savings are also affected by the fact that workers and retirees have different consumption The authors of this box are Daniel Baksa and Zsuzsa Munkacsi. 1Stylized data on demographics, labor markets, GDP and its components, and the fiscal sector are considered to capture the long-term characteristics of\n\nan extension of the global overlapping-generations model in Auclert and others (2024) to assess the general equilibrium implications of demographic forces for individual economies and globally (see Online Annex 2.3 for details). • Country coverage: The model includes 21 advanced economies, 4 emerging market economies (including China and India, which together account for almost 50 percent of emerging market economies’ GDP), and a bloc economy comprising 44 low- income 6The focus of the chapter is on aging-induced pressures on interest rates due to changes in the age structure of economies and their impact on savings supply and investment demand. However, the future direction of interest rates is also shaped by other factors influ- encing investment demand, such as future productivity trends as well as public spending to tackle pressing policy issues such as climate change or national security.\n\n29 advanced and 12 emerging market economies over 2000–22 to establish the extent of healthy-aging trends and their association with labor market outcomes. It then employs a multicountry, overlapping-generations general equilibrium model cov- ering 69 economies—representing about two-thirds of global output and the world’s population—to assess the economic implications of global aging through the end of the century. After baseline projections under current policies are established, the model is used to assess the potential impact of targeted progrowth policies to cush- ion against the growth and fiscal implications of aging. The chapter’s main findings are as follows: • Economies worldwide are aging rapidly as a result of declining fertility and rising life expectancy, with the pace of aging varying significantly across regions. No longer confined to advanced economies, aging is accelerating in many emerging market and mid- dle-income economies. Meanwhile, the window for reaping demographic dividends in younger, low-in- come countries is gradually closing. • In many countries,\n\naging on both growth and interest rates will have important implications for public finances. Third, beyond chronological age, physiological aging also influences individuals’ labor supply and retirement decisions. In line with findings in the previous section, research suggests that physiological functioning is a key predictor of individuals’ labor force participation and productivity, independent of their chronological age (Kotschy, Bloom, and Scott 2024). Improvements in how individuals age can thus affect education, work, and saving decisions, with broad implications for aggre- gate labor supply, interest rates, and economic growth. Finally, asynchronous aging across countries creates opportunities for efficiency gains from cross- border reallocation of production factors. Capital may flow from old, high-savings economies to younger, capital-scarce economies, shaping external balances (Gourinchas and Rey 2014; Auclert and others 2024). Similarly, labor may gradually migrate from younger, labor-abundant economies to older economies facing labor scarcity. The Model This chapter employs\n\nFirst, variations in fertility, mortality, and migration have an impact on both population growth rates and age structures. Given individuals’ typical life cycle—birth, schooling, working, and retirement— chronological age thresholds defining economic activity and retirement relative to life expectancy play a critical role. A rising share of the working-age population (those ages 15–64) boosts labor supply and economic growth, whereas an increasing old-age dependency ratio (number of individuals ages 65 and older relative to the number in the working-age population) weighs on growth and strains public finances on account of higher spending on pensions, health care, and long- term care. These pressures intensify as the lifespan beyond retirement age lengthens.5 Second, the expected length of working lives relative to retirement influences individuals’ saving behavior. If life expectancy increases while the effective retirement age remains unchanged, individuals tend to save more to smooth consumption over their lives, driving up aggregate savings. Moreover, if the within-economy age profiles of wealth"

      "a so-called youth bulge, with a high proportion of young people set to enter the workforce. However, challenges associated with high levels of informality, lack of jobs, and limited social protection are preventing the full absorption of these young people into workforces. This imbalance of labor supply, between youth-poor and youth-rich countries, can be partly alleviated by a flow of younger migrants and refugees into aging countries. Such a global resource reallocation could simultaneously ease the economic pressures from a smaller labor force in destination economies and a lack of opportunities in origin economies. However, these potential gains in a world of asynchronous aging hinge on a market-based match between the skills of young migrants and the youth-intensive comparative advan- tages of destination economies. Migration policies can support or hinder the redistribution of young workers by affecting individuals’ ability to move to countries where their skills are most needed. Migration and the Demographic Match Globally, migrants and refugees are typically younger—with a larger proportion of them of\n\noffset by negative contributions of others (Rowthorn 2008). But once capital taxes paid by employers of immigrant labor are taken into consideration, the benefits of working-age immigrants for fiscal outturns may be positive, even those for immigrants who do not have a high school education (Clemens 2022). Furthermore, if migrants do not make claims on government expenditure in old age, then net lifetime benefits to their destination economies may be enhanced (Rowthorn 2008). Investment and labor market integration chal- lenges may be more pertinent for some emerging market and developing economies because of broader The author of this box is Samuel Mann. institutional-capacity constraints. Furthermore, these economies are often the largest recipients of refugee flows, which—if they are large and unexpected— can result in more acute integration challenges and skills mismatches (Evans and Fitzgerald 2017; Brell, Dustmann, and Preston 2020). Indeed, even in regard to advanced economies there is evidence that\n\nthat improve the age-friendliness of jobs can also support longer working lives. Combating biases and discrimination against older individuals is also important, as the former can limit access to reskill- ing opportunities and lead to premature exits from the labor force (Gaillard and Desmette 2010; Lamont, Swift, and Abrams 2015; Officer and others 2020; Alcover and others 2021). Policies aimed at reducing labor force participation gaps, particularly by fostering higher female labor force participation, can also provide substantial growth dividends to counter demographic headwinds. T o avert an adverse impact on fertility, policies should aim for improving the work-life balance for women, including improved parental leave systems, expanding on afford- able childcare options, and promoting flexible work arrangements (Gu and others 2024). Furthermore, enhanced global integration can play a crucial role in supporting growth amid aging trends occurring at different paces and timings across countries. In particular, policies that enhance access to international financial\n\nthe labor outcomes of older workers, including health policies and those pertaining to continued training and development, can improve those workers’ labor market attachment and productivity (Chapter 2). A well-designed mix of labor market interventions can also contribute to gradually raising the effective retirement age. In addition to domestic labor market policies, evidence suggests that increased migration flows can attenuate challenging demographic outlooks while mildly boosting growth (Chapter 3). This requires facilitating the swift labor market integration of migrants (Caselli and others 2024) and ensuring that skills are well matched with job opportunities (Beltran Saavedra and others 2024). Measures to attenuate the distributional impacts of labor market reforms, as well as governance reforms, can further strengthen trust in public institutions (see Chapter 3 of the October 2024 WEO). Robust regu- latory frameworks coupled with investments in digital infrastructure and a digitally competent workforce are critical to ensure gains from new technologies are broadly shared across the workforce\n\nCHAPTER 3 JOURNEyS AND JUNCTIONS: SPILLO vERS FROM MIgRATION AND REFUgEE POLICIES 91International Monetary Fund | April 2025 Increased longevity and falling fertility are driving a secular rise in old-age dependency largely in advanced economies, but also in maturing emerging market economies. Advanced economies are projected to see old-age dependency rise from 20 older people for every 100 working-age individuals at the turn of the century to 50 by the end of 2050, an increase that effectively leaves one person over the age of 65 in the care of two working-age adults. The shrinking labor force is not only holding back potential growth (see the April 2024 World Economic Outlook, Chapter 3), but it is also increasing fiscal strains caused by higher health-spending needs alongside fewer workers to pay into pension systems.

Beyond aggregate output effects, shifts in migration flows can have broad-ranging macroeconomic impacts on destination economies. For instance, empirical studies find positive impacts of immigration on productivity—often attributed to complementarities between native and immigrant workers (Peri 2011; Ortega and Peri 2014; Alesina, Harnoss, and Rapoport 2015; Jaumotte, Koloskova, and Saxena 2016). Such complementarities are also cited by the literature for limited evidence that migration affects the wages or employment of native workers (Kerr and Kerr 2011; Peri 2014). High-skilled immigration, in particu- lar, is associated with better economic outcomes, including higher wages for natives and enhanced firm performance. The results from the gravity model suggest that there are spillovers from changes in migration and refugee policies. However, care is required to inter- pret them: Migration and refugee flows may influ- ence policies rather than\n\nemployment opportunities that fully utilize their skills. The benefits from their contri- butions are larger, notably in the long term, if they are well integrated into the labor market. Evidence indi- cates that the complementarity of migrants and refugee skills with those of natives and the strength of inte- gration policies matter also for emerging market and developing economies (Viseth 2021). However, even in situations in which refugees have a common language and culture, legal and structural barriers mean that they tend to work in the informal sector (Alvarez and others 2022).

Just as policies have helped shape the level and com- position of observed legal flows, so too have changes in the acceptance of migrants and refugees, which has been deteriorating in several major destination economies (Figure 3.2, panel 1). Increased media cov- erage of migration has further driven policy discourse (Figure 3.2, panel 2). Survey responses suggest that migration-related pressures are also unlikely to abate, because the intention to migrate remains robust despite the inability of all potential migrants to reach their preferred destination (Figure 3.2, panel 3). Migrants from emerging market and developing economies often aspire to move to advanced economies—either within or outside their region—but they are more likely to end up in other nearby economies within the same income group.

Evidence suggests that labor market outcomes of refugees are significantly worse than those of native populations and initially tend to generate net fiscal costs (Evans and Fitzgerald 2017; Brell, Dustmann, and Preston 2020).

A portion of DOE’s environmental liability at various field sites includes anticipated costs for facilities managed by DOE’s ongoing program operations, which will ultimately require stabilization, deactivation, and decommissioning. The estimates are largely based upon a cost -estimating model. Site specific estimates are used in lieu of the cost- estimating model, when available. Cost estimates for ongoing program facilities are updated each year. For facilities newly contaminated since FY 1997, cleanup costs are allocated to the periods benefiting from the operations of the facilities. Facilities’ cleanup costs allocated to future periods and not included in the environmental and disposal liabilities amounted to $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion for fiscal years ending September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

Congressional appropriations at lower -than anticipated levels or lack of congressional approval, unplanned delays in project completions, unforeseen technical issues, obtaining regulatory approval, among other things, could cause increases in life -cycle costs. DOE’s environmental and disposal liabilities also include the estimated cleanup and post -closure responsibilities, including surveillance and monitoring activities, soil and groundwater remediation, and disposition of excess material for sites. DOE is responsible for the post -closure activities at many of the closure sites as well as other sites. The costs for these post-closure activities are estimated for a period of 75 years after the balance sheet date, i.e., through 2099 in FY 2024 and through 209 8 in FY 2023. While some post -cleanup monitoring and other long -term stewardship activities post- 2099 are included in the liability, there are others DOE expects to continue beyond 2099 for which the\n\nto host nations. DOD continues its efforts to reasonably estimate required restoration costs. Environmental liabilities change over time because of laws and regulation updates, technology advances, inflation or deflation factors and disposal plan revisions. DOD revised estimates resulting from previously unknown contaminants, reestimation based on different assumptions, and other changes in project scope. Please refer to the financial statements of the main contributing entities, DOD and DOE, for additional information regarding environmental and disposal liabilities, including cleanup costs. Legal contingent liabilities including contingencies related to environmental legal disputes are recognized as an other liability on the Balance Sheet.

An example of a probable contingency that could result in a loss against the government for DOE and HHS is provided below.
