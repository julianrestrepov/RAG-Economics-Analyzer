      "FY 2024 REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) 168 Fiscal Projections in Context In this Financial Report , a sustainable fiscal policy is defined as one where the federal debt -to-GDP ratio is stable or declining over the projection period. However, this definition does not indicate what a sustainable debt -to-GDP ratio might be. Any particular debt ratio is not the ultimate goal of fiscal policy. Rather, the goals of fiscal policy are many including financing public goods, such as infrastructure and government services; promoting a strong and growing economy; and managing the debt so that it is not a burden on future generations. These goals are interrelated, and readers should consider how policies intended to affect one might depend on or affect another. This Financial Report shows that current policy under this Financial R eport’s assumptions is not sustainable. In evaluating policies that could make policy sustainable, note that debt may play roles in both facilitating and hindering a healthy economy. For example, government deficit spending supports demand and allows the economy to emerge from recessions more quickly. Debt may also be a cost -effective means of financing capital investment that promotes future economic growth, which may in turn make future debt levels more manageable. However, economic theory also suggests that high levels of debt may contribute to higher interest rates, leading to lower private investment and a smaller capital stock that the economy can use to grow. Unfortunately, it is unclear what debt -to-GDP ratio would be sufficiently high to produce these negative outcomes, or whether the key concern is the level of debt per se, or a trend that shows debt increasing over time. While several empirical studies have attempted to discern a definite relationship between debt and economic growth from the past experience of countries, the evidence is mixed. One study suggested that debt -to-GDP ratios in excess of 90 percent had significant negative consequences for real GDP growth across advanced countries . 5 Real GDP growth is generally lower by about 1 percent when the countries’ debt -to-GDP ratios are above 90 percent relative to the times when they are below 90 percent. 6 However, after removing sample countries with very high indebtedness – those with debt-to-GDP ratios of more than 120 percent – and very low indebtedness – those with debt -to-GDP ratios of less than 30 percent – the negative relationship between growth and debt is difficult to determine. Another study reports that differences in average GDP growth in countries with debt -to-GDP ratios between 30 -60 percent, 60- 90 percent, and 90 -120 percent cannot be statistically distinguished. 7 Some countries with high debt -to-GDP ratios have been observed to experience lower -than- average growth, while other countries with similarly high debt -to-GDP ratios have continued to enjoy robust growth. Analogously, low debt -to-GDP ratios are no guarantee of strong economic growth. Moreover, the direction of causality is 5 Reinhart, Carmen M., Vincent R. Reinhart and Kenneth S.

High debt may undermine growth through increased interest rates and lower business confidence, or low growth may contribute to high debt by depressing tax revenues and increasing deficit spending on social safety net programs. Nevertheless, to put the current and projected debt -to-GDP ratios in context, it is instructive to examine how the U.S. experience compares with that of other countries. The U.S. government’s debt as a percent of GDP is relatively large compared with central government debt of other countries, but far from the largest among developed countries. Based on historical data as reported by the IMF for 2 9 advanced economies, the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2022 ranged from 12.4 percent of GDP to 213.2 percent of GDP. 8 The U.S. is not included in this set of statistics, which underscores the difficulty in calculating debt ratios under consistent definitions, but the 2024 debt -to-GDP ratio for the U.S. government was approximately 98 percent. Despite using consistent definitions where available, these debt measures are not strictly comparable due to differences in the share of government debt that is debt of the central government, how government responsibilities are shared between central and local governments, how current policies compare with the past policies that determine the current level of debt, and how robustly each economy grows. The historical experience of the U.S. may also provide some perspective. As Chart 4 shows, the debt -to-GDP ratio was highest in the 1940s, following the debt buildup during World War II. In the projections in this Financial Report , the U.S. would reach the previous peak debt ratio in 2028. However, the origins of current and future federal debt are quite different from the wartime debt of the 1940s, which limits the pertinence of past experience. As the cross-country and historical comparisons suggest, there is a very imperfect relationship between the current level of central government debt and the sustainability of overall government policy. Past accrual of debt is certainly important, but current policies and their implications for future debt accumulation and future growth are as well. 8 Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, Main Aggregates and Balances, available at Data are for D1 debt liabilities for the central government, excluding social security funds, for Advanced Economies.\n\n25 FY 2024 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (with some adjustments), is subject to a statutory ceiling (i.e., the debt limit). Note that when intra -governmental debt decreases, debt held by the public will increase by an equal amount (if the general account of the U .S. government is in deficit), so that there is no net effect on gross f ederal debt. At the end of FY 2024, debt subject to the statutory limit was $35.4 trillion.13 The federal debt held by the public measured as a percent of GDP (debt -to-GDP ratio) (Chart 7) compares the country’s debt to the size of its economy, making this measure sensitive to changes in both. Over time, the debt-to-GDP ratio has varied widely: • For most of the nation’s history, through the first half of the 20 th century, the debt -to-GDP ratio has tended to increase during wartime and decline during peacetime. • Chart 7 shows that wartime spending and borrowing pushed the debt -to-GDP ratio to an all- time high of 106 percent in 1946, soon after the end of World War II, but it decreased rapidly in the post-war years. • The ratio grew rapidly from the mid- 1970s until the early 1990s. Strong economic growth and fundamental fiscal decisions, including measures to reduce the federal deficit and implementation of binding PAYGO rules (which require that new tax or spending laws not add to the deficit), generated a significant decline in the debt -to-GDP ratio, from a peak of 48 percent in FYs 1993-1995, to 31 percent in 2001. • The debt-to-GDP ratio rose significantly in 2008- 2009 during the financial crisis and again in 2020- 2021 during the pandemic reflecting the government’s responses to both events and the resulting significant spending and deficit increases, as well as the economic challenges experienced during both periods. • During the first decade of the 21 st century, PAYGO rules were allowed to lapse, significant tax cuts were implemented, entitlements were expanded, and spending related to defense and homeland security increased. By September 2008, the debt-to-GDP ratio was 39 percent of GDP. • PAYGO rules were reinstated in 2010, but the extraordinary demands of the 2008 economic and financial crisis and the consequent actions taken by the federal government, combined with slower economic growth in the wake of the crisis, pushed the debt-to-GDP ratio up to 74 percent by the end of FY 2014. • The extraordinary demands of the pandemic, the government’s response, and pressures on the economy contributed to a rise in the debt-to-GDP ratio to approximately 100 percent during FY 2020 and FY 2021. • The debt was approximately 98 percent of GDP at the end of FY 2024. This ratio in creased during FY 2024 because debt grew faster than GDP.14,15 From Chart 7, since 1940, the average debt-to-GDP ratio is 51 percent. See Note 29 —Subsequent Events for information about events that occurred after the end of the fiscal year that may affect the government’s financial position and condition. 13 In FY 2023, Treasury faced a delay in raising the debt limit that required it to depart from its normal debt management proce dures and invoke legal authorities to avoid exceeding the statutory debt limit. During this period, extraordinary measures taken by Treasury resulted in federal debt securities not being issued to certain federal government accounts with the securities being restored, including lost interest, to the affec ted government accounts subsequent to the end of the delay period. Due to th e delay in raising the statutory debt limit, Treasury took extraordinary measures from January 19,\n\n79.9 80.8 82.2 83.7 85.3 87.3 89.0 90.3 Gross federal debtc 35,230 37,209 39,130 40,872 42,748 44,781 46,828 48,910 51,083 53,590 56,396 59,207 Debt subject to limitd 35,355 37,333 39,253 40,994 42,869 44,902 46,950 49,033 51,207 53,715 56,522 59,334 Average interest rate on debt held by the public (percent) 3.3 3.4 3.3 3.4 3.4 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.6 3.6 3.6 3.6 Data sources: Congressional Budget Office; Department of the Treasury.

The statutory debt limit was reinstated on January 2, 2025, and set at $36.1 trillion, matching the amount of total debt outstanding on the prior day. In the coming weeks, the Department of the Treasury is expected to announce a “debt issuance suspension period” and to take “extraordinary measures” to borrow additional funds without breaching the debt limit. The Deficit Control Act requires CBO to project spending, revenues, and deficits independently of the debt limit. For more details, see Congressional Budget Office, Federal Debt and the Statutory Limit, February 2023 (February 2023),\n\nborrowing reductions, and budget deficits have conversely yielded borrowing increases. However, the government’s debt operations are generally much more complex. Each year, trillions of dollars of debt matures and new debt is issued to take its place. In FY 2024, new borrowings were $28.8 trillion, and repayments of maturing debt held by the public were $26.9 trillion, both in creases over FY 2023. The $2.0 trillion increase in publicly held debt and accrued interest payable is largely attributable to the need to finance the government’s operations. In addition to debt held by the public, the government has about $7.1 trillion in intra -governmental debt outstanding, which arises when one part of the government borrows from another. It represents debt issued by Treasury and held by government accounts, including the Social Security ($2.8 trillion) and Medicare ($399.4 billion) Trust Funds. Intra - governmental debt is primarily held in government trust funds in the form of special nonmarketable securities by various parts of the government. Laws establishing government trust funds generally require excess trust fund receipts (including interest earnings) over disbursements to be invested in these special securities. Because these amounts are both liabilities of Treasury and assets of the government trust funds, they are eliminated as part of the consolidation process for the government-wide financial statements (see Financial Statement Note 12 —Federal Debt and Interest Payable). When those securities are redeemed, e.g., to pay Social Security benefits, the government must obtain the resources necessary to reimburse the trust funds. The sum of debt held by the public and intra -governmental debt equals gross federal debt, which"

Specifi- cally, the chapter asks the following questions: • Do changes in migration and refugee policies divert legal migrant and refugee flows to other economies or alter their composition? • How large and significant have spillovers to output from migration and refugee policy changes been? • Could international cooperation improve economic outcomes by distributing flows more evenly across economies? The analysis in the chapter focuses exclusively on “regular”—also referred to as “legal”—cross-border movement of migrants and refugees. Severe data con- straints preclude analysis in the chapter of irregular— also referred to as “illegal”—movement of people. 1 The term migrant is used to denote those persons who voluntarily leave their countries of origin for a vari- ety of reasons, including to pursue better economic opportunities. In contrast, the term refugee refers to those persons who are forced to flee their countries of 1Irregular migration is not defined in international law, but it broadly covers the movement of persons that takes place outside the laws, regulations, or international agreements governing the entry into or exit from the state of origin, transit, or destination. By the very nature of these flows being outside legal pathways, severe data limitations and selection bias preclude the analysis of such flows.

Shifts in migration and refugee policies in destination economies can result in spillovers by altering flows of legal migrants and refugees in the global economy. Although these policy changes cannot substitute for actions to sustainably address underlying pull and push factors, particularly those relating to forced displacement, they can help manage flows to these economies’ benefit. Improving behind-the-border migration and refugee policies on integration, together with infrastructure investment and active labor market policies, can help ease short- term congestion costs. International cooperation can also help redistribute these costs. Migration and Refugee Patterns and Policies Advanced economies continue to host some of the largest groups of migrants, mostly pulled from emerging market and developing economies. 3 Flows to advanced economies accounted for the bulk of global movements in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Since then, flows of both migrants and refugees between emerging market and developing economies have increased and now account for almost half of overall net flows, with three of the five largest increases in migrant and refugee stocks during 2010–24 having taken place in large emerging market economies (Figure 3.3). During 2020–24, most gross flows were also between economies within the same region and income group, highlighting the fact that migration and refugee journeys are frequently undertaken only over short distances (Figure 3.4). Recent developments also reflect a significant increase in flows of refugees who have been forcibly displaced or pushed from their homes by political instability, conflict, violence, persecutions, human rights violations, and natural disasters. About two- thirds of the stock of refugees are hosted in neigh- boring countries, with four out of the top five hosts being emerging market and developing economies (Box 3.1).4 The global distribution of refugees can 3These pull factors involved can include higher standards of living—including higher incomes, better health outcomes, stronger educational systems and institutions, and a safer environment—as well as linguistic, or cultural proximity, or family ties. 4Political instability, conflict, and natural disasters can contribute to push individuals from their homes and are key factors behind the increase in migrant and refugee flows between emerging market and developing economies. Deteriorating social and economic conditions and a lack of opportunities in origin economies are other examples of push factors. place a disproportionate burden on emerging market and developing economies, which are often not as well equipped as advanced economies to absorb the large inflows involved. Economic implications will vary according to the characteristics of migrant and refugee inflows. In general, migration has been found to be beneficial for advanced economies. • Migrants are generally more mobile geographically and occupationally than natives, allowing them Change in refugee stock Change in migrant stock Share in destination economy population in 2010 (percent, right scale) EMDE-EMDE refugee EMDE-AE refugee AE-AE migrant AE-EMDE refugee EMDE-EMDE migrant EMDE-AE migrant AE-EMDE migrant All /f_lows (percent of global population, right scale) Figure 3.3.

These findings underscore the amplifying effect of natural disasters on migration and refugee flows (Koubi, Stoll, and Spilker 2016), similar to the effect of precipitation (Hunter, Murray, and Riosmena 2013) and temperature (Cattaneo and Peri 2016). Spillovers from Forced Displacement Natural disasters and conflict-related shocks often intersect.1 The precise impact on displacement across borders will depend on the nature of underlying vul- nerabilities—and shocks—and the region in which they occur (Abel and others 2019).2 What is clear, however, is that most forced displacement occurs within (and between) emerging market and developing economies. Indeed, nearly two-thirds of refugees under the United 1About half of forcibly displaced people are living in countries affected by both (Goldberg and others 2024). 2Cross-country studies likely underestimate the impact on overall displacement owing to data limitations regarding internal displacement. Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ mandate and other people in need of international protection come from just four countries (Afghanistan, Syria, Ukraine, and Venezuela), and nearly 73 percent are hosted in emerging market and developing economies, with half the global total in just 10 such economies. The concentration of refugees among emerging mar- ket and developing destination economies—including many with limited fiscal capacity—highlights the challenges caused by poor integration. Evidence suggests that labor market outcomes of refugees are significantly worse than those of native populations and initially tend to generate net fiscal costs (Evans and Fitzgerald 2017; Brell, Dustmann, and Preston 2020). Recent research on the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia also finds that host countries often experience higher fiscal deficits following refugee inflows; the increases are associated with the provision of health, education, and subsistence services. Better integration of refugees can therefore help alleviate such pressures, because better labor market outcomes can not only help resolve labor shortages but also boost tax revenues and, more generally, aggregate demand and GDP growth (Bassanetti, Sacco, and Tieman, forthcoming).

      "CHAPTER 2 ThE RISE OF ThE SIL vER ECONOMy: GLObAL IMPLICATIONS OF POPULATION A GING 69International Monetary Fund | April 2025 Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping labor markets, transforming the way individuals work, communicate, and solve complex problems. Although recent advances in AI technology hold great potential to boost productivity by assisting workers and enabling them to focus more on complex and high-value tasks, they also pose risks by rendering certain skills obsolete, thereby increasing the risk of unemployment. Older workers (ages 55 and older) are particularly vulnerable, as historical evidence suggests that they are less likely to adapt to new technologies and transition to new occupations (Autor and Dorn 2009). Without ade- quate policy interventions, disruptions resulting from the realization of these risks may lead to reduced labor market participation, lower numbers of working hours, transitions to less suitable roles, premature workforce withdrawal, or any combination of these outcomes— further exacerbating labor market pressures in aging economies. However, if older workers are concentrated in occupations expected to expand and experience productivity gains as a result of AI, they may be well positioned to benefit from AI advancements, as long as they are able to use new technologies. T o measure the initial impact of AI on labor markets in a context of aging populations, this box examines both AI exposure and its potential to com- plement older workers. Occupations can be grouped into three categories: those at high risk of labor substitution (high exposure and low complementarity, or HELC), those likely to experience productivity and wage boosts (high exposure and high complementarity, or HEHC), and those less affected by AI adoption (low exposure).1 Regardless of demographic shifts, The authors of this box are Andresa H. Lagerborg, Carlo Pizzinelli, and Marina M. Tavares. 1Exposure is measured by the extent to which AI can replicate skills essential for a given occupation (Felten, Raj, and Seamans 2021), whereas the degree of complementarity measures how likely AI is to augment workers in certain occupations (Pizzinelli and others 2023). The complementary measure incorporates broader occupational factors that influence the likelihood of benefiting from AI adoption; see Pizzinelli and others (2023) for details. ongoing labor market trends indicate that occupations vulnerable to automation are already losing ground to those involving AI-enhanced roles. For instance, in the United States, vacancies in HELC occupations have expanded at a slower pace in locations with greater AI adoption, whereas HEHC job vacancies have remained stable or even increased slightly in these areas (Pizzi- nelli and others 2023). The likely impact of AI on older workers, in a manner similar to that in which it operates on younger cohorts, will depend largely on their levels of education (Figure 2.3.1). Workers with at most a high school diploma are predominantly employed in occupations with low exposure to AI, making them less susceptible to disruption from AI adoption. In contrast, workers with tertiary education are more exposed to AI, with more than 80 percent employed in AI-intensive occu- pations. However, most of those are concentrated in HEHC occupations, poised for productivity and wage gains.2 This suggests that, for a given educational level, older workers may benefit more from AI adoption than younger cohorts, as the former are relatively more concentrated in HEHC occupations. Interestingly, several features of jobs with high AI exposure are aligned with older workers’ prefer- ences. Over the past three decades, there has been a general rise in age-friendly jobs—characterized by less-demanding physical activity, lower levels of job hazards, and moderate work paces (Acemoglu, Mühlbach, and Scott 2022). Such features are attrac- tive for older workers and align with the positive gains in their cognitive capacities amid healthy aging docu- mented in this\n\nof jobs with high AI exposure are aligned with older workers’ prefer- ences. Over the past three decades, there has been a general rise in age-friendly jobs—characterized by less-demanding physical activity, lower levels of job hazards, and moderate work paces (Acemoglu, Mühlbach, and Scott 2022). Such features are attrac- tive for older workers and align with the positive gains in their cognitive capacities amid healthy aging docu- mented in this chapter.3 Indeed, data for the United States suggest that AI-exposed jobs are compatible 2This is based on data for Brazil (National Household Sample Survey) and the United States (Current Population Survey). About 65 percent of workers in Brazil and 45 percent in the United States work in HEHC occupations. 3Acemoglu, Mühlbach, and Scott (2022) find that this rise in age-friendly jobs has tended to benefit females, college graduates, and older workers (especially females, those with college educa- tion, or both), whereas male graduates have benefited the least. Box 2.3. The Impact of AI for Older Workers\n\nCHAPTER 2 ThE RISE OF ThE SIL vER ECONOMy: GLObAL IMPLICATIONS OF POPULATION A GING 71International Monetary Fund | April 2025 stress and reduce the occupations’ desirability among older workers. Despite these challenges, older workers are already more represented in occupations poised to benefit from AI than in those at risk from it. These findings suggest that improving job conditions— particularly through stress management, remote work options, and flexibility—could help retain older work- ers in AI-enhanced roles. Targeted policies remain necessary for older workers in HELC occupations. Across different education levels, 20–30 percent of older workers are employed in HELC jobs vulnerable to AI-driven disruptions. This group is particularly at risk, as historical data suggest older workers are less likely to switch jobs or occu- pations (Figure 2.3.3). As labor demand for HELC occupations declines, the ability of these workers to relocate to growing sectors of the economy may be limited, especially during the late stages of their careers. This highlights the need for targeted policies that facilitate job transitions. Active labor market pro- grams can help older workers adapt to new technolo- gies, and job transition support can mitigate the risk of early retirement from job displacement.

The development and diffusion of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is already well underway, and will be a key source of new economic opportunities. Significant uncertainty remains about the speed of AI adoption, and hence the impact on future prod uctivity and growth developments, with adoption dependent on existing endowments of labour and skills, investment, industry composition, and a range of domestic government policies. Structural reforms, including the measures set out above, could promote stronger AI uptake. Pro-competition reforms could sharpen the incentives for AI adoption and reduce the capacity for successful AI firms to build and exploit monopoly positions.

Using a multicountry computable general equilib- rium (CGE) model, IMF-ENV (Chateau and others 2025), this Special Feature seeks to answer the follow- ing questions: (1) How fast have sectors involved in the development and delivery of AI-related services grown in recent years, and what has happened to their electric- ity consumption? (2) How does the projected electricity demand from AI by 2030 compare with other drivers of demand, such as EVs? (3) What is the impact on energy prices and the mix of electricity sources under alternative policy scenarios? (4) What will be the impact of data centers’ growth on carbon emissions? The Growing Macroeconomic Relevance of AI-Producing Sectors In the US, AI-producing sectors’ value added quadrupled from $278 billion (in constant 2017 dollars) to $1.13 trillion between 2010 and 2023, a rate much faster than those for private nonfarm and manufacturing value added. As a result, these sectors’ share in total US GDP increased from 2.4 percent in 2013 to 3.5 percent in 2023, with the data-processing sector nearly doubling its share in the same period. Meanwhile, the share of manufacturing declined by 1.5 percentage points (Figure 1.SF .2, panel 1). This fast growth of AI-producing sectors was driven by remarkable gains in labor productivity, with value added per employee in the data-processing sector 1Large fixed costs create economies of scale that concentrate AI development among a few large players (Korinek and Vipra 2024), although this pool has expanded recently as more variation in the cost structure of large language models has emerged."

      "Federal Reserve Bank ofNew YorkSummary of Economic ActivityEconomic activity in the Second District continued to decline slightly as tariff-related uncertaintycontinued to weigh on businesses. Employment in the region was mostly unchanged during thereporting period, and wage growth remained modest. Selling prices rose at a moderate pace,marking some acceleration since the previous period. Input prices continued to rise at a strongpace. Manufacturing activity picked up modestly following a prolonged slump. Activity in the ser-vice sector declined at a moderate pace. Consumer spending increased slightly. With demandremaining solid, housing markets were steady across the District. Businesses were slightly pessi-mistic about the outlook.Labor MarketsEmployment in the region was mostly unchanged during the reporting period. Firms in information,construction, and education and health reported a decline in headcounts, while personal servicesfirms as well as wholesalers reported some growth in employment.Labor supply continued to exceed demand in many industries. With heightened uncertainty, busi-nesses are still in wait-and-see mode and have been reluctant to meaningfully reduce or expandtheir workforces, and larger businesses in particular have been less willing to make commitments.An employment agency in upstate New York reported that jobs were harder to get; workers werestaying put, and attrition remained extremely low. Still, workers remained somewhat hard to find insome industries, particularly in manufacturing and healthcare, as well as construction, where adecline in immigrant labor has begun to lead to project delays. Some employers shifted to four-dayworkweeks to retain workers. There were no signs of major layoffs in the region.Wage growth held steady at a modest pace. Firms in construction and in leisure and hospitalitysaw strong growth in wages, while wage growth in finance and transportation remained moretepid. Contacts anticipated continued modest wage growth in the coming months. 9\n\nNational SummaryOverall Economic ActivityMost of the twelve Federal Reserve Districts reported little or no change in economic activity sincethe prior Beige Book period—the four Districts that differed reported modest growth. AcrossDistricts, contacts reported flat to declining consumer spending because, for many households,wages were failing to keep up with rising prices. Contacts frequently cited economic uncertaintyand tariffs as negative factors. New York reported that “consumers were being squeezed by risingcosts of insurance, utilities, and other expenses.” Contacts observed the following responses tothe consumer pullback. Retail and hospitality sectors offered deals and promotions to help price-sensitive consumers stretch their dollars—supporting steady demand from domestic leisure tour-ists but not offsetting falling demand from international visitors. The auto sector noted flat toslightly higher sales, while consumer demand increased for parts and services to repair oldervehicles. Manufacturing firms reported shifting to local supply chains where feasible and oftenusing automation to cut costs. The push to deploy AI partly explains the surge of data centerconstruction—a rare strength in commercial real estate noted by the Philadelphia, Cleveland, andChicago Districts. Atlanta and Kansas City reported that data centers had increased energydemand in their Districts. Overall, sentiment was mixed among the Districts. Most firms eitherreported little to no change in optimism or expressed differing expectations about the direction ofchange from their contacts.Labor MarketsEleven Districts described little or no net change in overall employment levels, while one Districtdescribed a modest decline. Seven Districts noted that firms were hesitant to hire workersbecause of weaker demand or uncertainty. Moreover, contacts in two Districts reported anincrease in layoffs, while contacts in multiple Districts reported reducing headcounts throughattrition—encouraged, at times, by return-to-office policies and facilitated, at times, by greaterautomation, including new AI tools. In turn, most Districts mentioned an increase in the number ofpeople looking for jobs. However, half of the Districts noted that contacts reported a reduction inthe availability of immigrant labor, with New York, Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco high-lighting its impact on the construction industry. Half of the Districts described modest growth inwages, while most of the others reported moderate growth. Two Districts noted little or no changein wages.Note: This report was prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia based on information collected on or beforeAugust 25, 2025. This document summarizes comments received from contacts outside the Federal Reserve System andis not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials. 1\n\nFederal Reserve Bank ofDallasSummary of Economic ActivityEconomic activity in the Eleventh District expanded modestly. Growth picked up in nonfinancial ser-vices and manufacturing. Retail sales increased, and loan volume rose, driven by increases inresidential and commercial real estate lending. Agricultural conditions were favorable. Meanwhile,housing market activity remained weak, and drilling activity and oil production were flat. Employ-ment levels were unchanged, and wage growth was moderate. Prices increased modestly apartfrom the manufacturing sector, where price pressures intensified due to tariffs. Outlooks improvedbut there was widespread trepidation regarding shifting trade policy, high interest rates, and morerestrictive immigration policy. Just over one-fifth of firms said they expect a decline in demand fortheir goods or services over the next six months.Labor MarketsEmployment was fairly flat over the reporting period. A roughly equal share of service firmsreported increasing versus decreasing employment. Staffing firms reported slow hiring activity,with a couple of contacts noting that companies were opting to reallocate workload internally orcutting staff in response to cost pressures from tariffs. A restaurant chain cited plans to automatein some areas to reduce labor costs. Homebuilders, oilfield services firms, and nonprofits notedtrimming headcounts. Meanwhile, overall manufacturing employment grew moderately, althoughsome transportation equipment and petrochemical manufacturers reported reducing staff to con-tain costs. Overall, wage growth was moderate, and firms noted improved availability ofapplicants.PricesSelling prices increased at a modest pace, except for the manufacturing sector where price pres-sures rose reflecting the widespread impact of tariffs. According to an August Dallas Fed survey,nearly half of firms noted being negatively impacted by tariffs, and all of them noted facing higherinput costs as a result. Among those passing through tariff cost increases to customers in theform of higher prices, roughly half noted doing so within a month of the tariff taking effect, andthree quarters are doing so within three months. Reports on the extent of pass through weremixed, with only 21 percent noting full pass through thus far.

    "question": "Why did a European stainless steel importer make customers pay for the full cost of tariffs?",
    "retrieved_contexts": [
      "PricesPricing pressures continued to rise during the reporting period, driven mostly by tariff-relatedcosts. Selling prices rose moderately, marking some acceleration since the previous period. Inputprices continued to rise at a strong pace. Multiple contacts reported a significant rise in insuranceand utility costs. So far, there has been little impact on new car prices from the tariffs due toexemptions and implementation lags, with some manufacturers absorbing increased costs. Animporter of European stainless steel used in the auto and aerospace industries reported passingon the full cost of the tariffs to customers, and a shipping company noted customers wereimporting European steel that just became more expensive with higher tariffs and no alternativedomestic suppliers. An IT provider noted that their input costs were starting to increase as theyran out of supplies purchased before tariff increases. Several businesses reported that theyplanned to hike prices to cover the higher cost of tariffed inputs. Contacts increasingly anticipateda pickup in the pace of price growth in the months ahead.Consumer SpendingConsumer spending increased slightly. Still, contacts reported that consumers were beingsqueezed by rising costs of insurance, utilities, and other expenses, limiting their discretionaryincome. Low home sales reduced household shopping for home improvement products and fur-nishings. Alcohol sales were slow during the summer. A restaurant in upstate New York notedhigher customer counts but lower average spending. Upstate New York auto dealers reported amodest sales rebound from a summer slowdown that followed a spring surge to avoid potentialtariffs.Manufacturing and DistributionManufacturing activity picked up modestly following a prolonged slump. New orders and shipmentsincreased modestly. However, uncertainty and volatility related to tariffs and trade policy continuedto weigh on firms, with many delaying decision-making and strategy-setting. One regional manufac-turer reported significant delays in receiving inputs from a U.S. supplier that was exceedingly busydue to firms shifting purchases to domestic sources. A wood products manufacturer in upstateNew York reported a sharp decline in sales to Canada, while shortages of pine logs resulted in amill stoppage, even with solid demand for pine products. Wholesale and distribution-related firmssaw slight increases in business activity. One contact noted that trucking rates remained lowerthan normal as sagging demand forced trucking companies to lower their rates. A coffee roasterreported that tariffs on Brazilian coffee and on other supplies were creating shockwaves throughthe supply chain. A wholesale firm in New Jersey noted a sharp decline in capital purchases fromlocal governments. Delivery times lengthened, and supply availability worsened slightly. Inventories 10The Beige Book\n\n10  FINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE IN UNCERTAIN TIMES © OECD 2025 4. Additional increases in US bilateral tariff rates on almost all trading partners since mid -May have raised the (ex-ante) effective tariff rate on US merchandise imports to an estimated 19.5% as of end-August (using 2024 -based weights) (Figure 4, Panel A) . This is the highest tariff rate since 1933 and 4.1 percentage points higher than the rate in mid-May (used in the June OECD Economic Outlook). At the sectoral level, US tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports have been raised by an additional 25 percentage points and tariffs on all copper imports by 50 percentage points. New bilateral agreements covering tariffs , investment and other areas of cooperation have been concluded with some countries since May, including the European Union, Japan and Indonesia, reducing the tariff rates being applied on some items. Amongst the G20, China, India and Brazil face the highest increases in bilateral US tariff rates this year. Ongoing legal challenges and negotiations, and the risk of new tariffs on currently-exempt items, add to uncertainty about trade policies. Newspaper-based measures of trade policy uncertainty have moderated since April 2025, but remain high by historical standards. 5. The impacts of higher tariff rates are yet to be fully felt in the US economy. This reflects a combination of factors, with firms making use of inventories and ample profit margins to avoid or absorb the initial impact of higher tariffs, lags between the announcement and imposition of higher tariff rates, and the exemption of goods already in transit from higher tariff rates. At the margins, there are also some signs of reduced purchases of goods subject to higher tariff increases (Figure 4, Panel D). Observed (ex-post) monthly tariff rates calculated from United States revenue and trade statistics (reported customs duties divided by the value of merchandise imports) have risen sharply this year, but lag estimated effective tariff rates (Figure 4, Panel B), portending an increase in tariff collection in the coming months. 6. There are already some signs that tariffs have begun to be passed through into consumer prices, notably durable goods with a high import content (Figure 4, Panel C). Recent business surveys also suggest that continued increases in manufacturing input prices in the United States are being passed through to output prices . There are few indications from import price data that foreign companies have sought to offset higher US tariffs in the prices of exports to the United States, with one notable exception being the lower price of passenger car exports from Japan.\n\nUS International Trade Commission; and IMF staff calculations. Note: The Jan. 20–Apr. 1 tariffs in 2025 include 20 percent tariffs on China; 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum; 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada; and a 10 percent tariff on Canadian energy imports. A United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) carve-out is assumed to halve the effective tariff increase for Canada and Mexico. The April 2 tariffs include auto sector tariffs and country-specific tariffs, applying exemptions provided in Annex II of the Executive Order per IMF staff judgment. The April 9 tariffs include an increase in the tariffs on China to 145 percent and a reduction in other country-specific tariffs to 10 percent. It also includes exemptions on some electronic products announced on April 11.

Retail contacts cited highercosts related to tariffs on vehicles, beef, and other commodities. One healthcare contact said tar-iffs had affected hospital drug pricing, pushing up the cost per unit of service. Moreover, elevatedcosts for technology such as software and AI continued to impact banking and professional andbusiness services contacts. Contacts generally expected costs to grow at a strong pace in thecoming months.On balance, contacts reported that selling prices grew modestly in recent weeks, continuing thetrend since the start of 2025. Across industries, contacts continued to report raising prices tooffset higher materials costs. Some manufacturers and auto dealers reported passing along100 percent of tariff increases to customers, while others said they were slowly raising prices inresponse to higher tariffs. Pricing power diminished for some contacts, including some metalmanufacturers, who were reducing prices to remain competitive. Several contacts in manufacturingand professional and business services reported waiting to see “how things settle” beforeincreasing prices but anticipated doing so in the near term.Consumer SpendingOn balance, contacts reported flat consumer spending in recent weeks, with several citing afford-ability concerns, especially for low- and middle-income consumers. One auto dealership believedincreased prices caused buyers to postpone purchases, while another thought customers weremaking purchases ahead of further tariff increases. Overall, contacts expected consumerspending to be unchanged in the coming months. Two auto dealers who expected sales to declinecited affordability concerns and increased strain on household budgets. Two retail store contactswho expected no change in sales cited concerns over the still-unclear impact of tariffs on con-sumer confidence and spending.ManufacturingOn balance, contacts reported little change in demand for manufactured goods in recent weeks.Many firms continued to cite uncertainty about import tariffs as a primary reason for flat or lowerorders, and a few contacts added that they or their customers were concerned about a possibleweakening of overall economic conditions. Producers that reported higher demand attributed it tocustomers seeking domestic sources of imported products or moving forward with previously post-poned purchases. By contrast, metal producers and others selling into heavy industry reported asoftening of demand. Manufacturers generally expected demand to increase modestly in thecoming months. 18The Beige Book\n\nCHAPTER 1 GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES 33International Monetary Fund | April 2025 fully pass higher import costs through to consumers. Both assumptions cause the tariff increases to result in higher inflationary pressures in the United States. Figure 1.2.1 shows the impact across the three ver- sions of GIMF (the standard specification plus the two alternative versions) for bilateral real exchange rates with respect to the United States, for inflation, and for GDP . Results are shown in deviations from a no- tariff baseline for the world, the United States, China, Canada and Mexico combined (CMX in the figure), the euro area, and other Asian countries. Currencies. Higher tariffs lead to a depreciation of currencies with respect to the dollar (Figure 1.2.1, panel 1). The euro area and Other Asia experience the largest depreciations. The yuan depreciates by less relative to others on account of the exchange rate management assumption. Exchange rate movements are considerably smaller if tariff increases are perceived as temporary, about one-third the size relative to the version of the model in which tariffs are perceived as permanent. Inflation. The impact on inflation is uncertain (Figure 1.2.1, panel 2). In the first version, the effect is limited, except in China, which experiences a decrease of about 60 basis points in 2026 because of the man- aged exchange rate. Inflationary effects in the United States are offset by the appreciation of the dollar and some decline in markups. When tariffs are perceived to be temporary and import costs are fully passed on, US inflation increases by close to 50 basis points in 2025. The impact on inflation outside the United States is instead larger if the dollar plays a central role in the pricing of global trade, as the appreciation of the dollar raises production costs globally. Activity. Tariffs have a large negative impact on global activity. The effect is largest for Canada and Mexico, China, and the United States (Figure 1.2.1, panel 3). The impact on China also reflects a less-than- full adjustment of the exchange rate. The negative impact on the United States is amplified in the version of GIMF in which tariffs are perceived to be tempo- rary and import costs are fully passed on, because the resulting increase in inflation leads to a tightening of monetary policy.

      "Central bank flexibility: Additional interest rate cuts from the Bank of Canada aren’t in our base case forecasts, but policymakers can reduce rates if needed. Net trade likely won’t repeat its Q2 decline, household spending has continued to surprise on the upside, and fiscal support (better suited to address sector-specific tariff headwinds) is increasing. However, weak Q2 GDP and recent labour market reports makes a September rate cut essentially a toss-up. Some downside risks remain U.S. dependency risks: Canada maintains relatively favorable U.S. tariff rates, but that provides little comfort if broader U.S. tariff hikes cause the tightly integrated North American industrial sector to shrink. The U.S. unemployment rate remains historically low, but job growth has stalled since April with weakness concentrated in industrial sectors where Canadian economic ties are strongest. Maintaining CUSMA exemption is critical on both sides of the border: The CUSMA exemption continues to protect most Canadian exports from U.S. tariffs, and maintaining it is vital for Canadian exporters. But, as we argued here, the agreement is also important for U.S. importers, who would see already escalating import costs accelerate significantly without it. CUSMA doesn’t (automatically) expire until 2036, and negotiations to extend the agreement (negotiated by the first Trump administration) beyond that time start next year at the latest. U.S. trade policy remains highly unpredictable, but the continuation of CUSMA protections through multiple rounds of U.S. tariffs is an implicit recognition of its mutual benefits. RBC Economics | thoughtleadership.rbc.com/economics QUARTERLY CANADIAN OUTLOOK | September 15, 2025RBC Economics\n\nDe-escalation scenario Trade tensions ease. The United States lowers—but does not completely remove—its tariﬀs on other countries. As a result, Canada and other countries lower their retaliatory tariﬀs. Uncertainty decreases but does not disappear. Compared with the current tariﬀ scenario, the United States: halves the level of sectoral tariﬀs (steel and aluminum, motor vehicles and parts) reduces the tariﬀs on Canadian goods that do not comply with CUSMA to 10% from 25% reduces the increase in tariﬀs on Chinese goods from 28 percentage points to 24 percentage points reduces the weighted average increase in tariﬀs on other countries from 9 percentage points to 6 percentage points Canada and other countries react by scaling back countermeasures on the United States: Canada removes its counter-tariﬀs on the United States China reduces the incremental tariﬀ increases imposed on the United States from 13 percentage points in the current tariﬀ scenario to 1 percentage point other countries maintain their policy of not retaliating against the United States Other key assumptions include: Trade policy uncertainty is roughly halved from the level in the current tariﬀ scenario. Potential output in Canada is 0.2% stronger at the end of 2027 compared with the current tariﬀ scenario. Over the scenario horizon, the per-barrel prices for oil are assumed to be US$70 for Brent, US$65 for West Texas Intermediate and US$55 for Western Canadian Select. The Canadian dollar averages 74 cents US over the scenario. Other assumptions remain unchanged. 23\n\nCurrent tariff scenario The current tariﬀ scenario assumes the following tariﬀs are in place. US tariﬀ measures on Canada: a 50% tariﬀ on imports of steel and aluminum a 25% tariﬀ on the non-US content of imported motor vehicles a 25% tariﬀ on motor vehicle parts that do not comply with the Canada-United States- Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) a 25% tariﬀ on imported goods that do not comply with CUSMA (a 10% tariﬀ on energy or potash products), other than on motor vehicles and parts CUSMA-compliance is assumed to be: 100% for energy exports 95% for all other goods exports1 Canada’s retaliatory tariﬀs on the United States: a 25% tariﬀ on approximately $60 billion of imports of US goods a 25% tariﬀ on the US content of vehicles imported from the United States with exceptions for CUSMA-compliant components made in Canada and Mexico United States measures on countries other than Canada: a tariﬀ of at least 50% on imports of steel, aluminum and certain related household appliances a tariﬀ of at least 25% on the non-US content of imported motor vehicles and parts, with lower tariﬀ rates for the European Union, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom, as established in their trade agreements an increase in tariﬀs of 28 percentage points on goods from China compared with the start of 2025, representing both bilateral and sectoral tariﬀs an increase in tariﬀs of 9 percentage points on average on countries outside of Canada and China compared with the start of 2025 China’s retaliatory tariﬀs on the United States: an increase in tariﬀs on US goods equivalent to 13 percentage points China’s retaliatory tariﬀs on Canada: 100% on some agricultural products and 25% on pork and seafood products Other countries: no retaliatory tariﬀs imposed Other key assumptions include: Trade policy uncertainty remains elevated around the world into 2026 Trade tensions reduce total factor productivity (TFP) and investment, lowering the level of Canadian potential output by 0.5% in 2027 Global potential output is lower by 0.1% in 2027 Over the scenario horizon, the per-barrel prices for oil are assumed to be US$65 for Brent, US$60 for West Texas Intermediate and US$50 for Western Canadian Select The Canadian dollar is assumed to average 73 cents US over the scenario 22\n\nThe trade war took a larger than expected bite out of Canadian gross domestic product in Q2, but data still shows an economy that has weathered recent trade pressures better than feared when uncertainty was most acute in the spring. Trade-sensitive sectors have faced significant challenges. Exports declined sharply in Q2 and manufacturing contracted by an annualized 8%. U.S. imports of steel and aluminum products from Canada targeted with 50% tariffs decreased almost 50% year-over-year in July. But critically, most Canadian exports continue to cross the border duty-free thanks to CUSMA exemptions, and weakness remains largely contained to directly impacted sectors. Employment in manufacturing and transportation sectors are down 32,000 from the end of 2024, but up 70,000 in other industries. Canadian outlook Quarterly Canadian outlook Low but positive growth aheadRBC Economics September 15, 2025 RBC Economics | thoughtleadership.rbc.com/economics\n\nThe path of US tariffs remains uncertain Because the trade environment remains so uncertain, the path for Canadian growth and inﬂation is less clear than usual. If the trade conﬂict were to escalate or de- escalate, those shifts would alter economic outcomes. Since January, the United States has threatened, imposed, paused and reinstated tariﬀs on many of its trading partners. It has negotiated agreements with some countries, but many others still face threats of signiﬁcant new tariﬀs. These policy shifts have happened quickly and sometimes without warning. As a result, this Report presents a current tariﬀ scenario instead of a base-case projection as well as two alternative scenarios—a de-escalation scenario and an escalation scenario. When taken together, these scenarios encompass a range of potential outcomes. The current tariﬀ scenario is presented in the Outlook and Global economy sections. This section presents the de-escalation and escalation scenarios. In the de-escalation scenario, tariﬀs are lower than in the current tariﬀ scenario, and the degree of trade uncertainty decreases. Compared with the current tariﬀ scenario: economic growth in Canada rebounds faster once tariﬀs are reduced and uncertainty eases inﬂation in Canada is lower over most of the scenario horizon, primarily because tariﬀs are lifted In the escalation scenario, trade negotiations deteriorate, causing tariﬀs to rise signiﬁcantly. Compared with the current tariﬀ scenario: economic growth in Canada slows markedly, with gross domestic product (GDP) about 1.25% lower by the end of the scenario horizon inﬂation rises faster, because of the increase in tariﬀs, to around 2.5% in 2026, before stabilizing around 2% in 2027 De-escalation scenario In this scenario, the United States lowers its tariﬀs against Canada and other countries. In response, China signiﬁcantly reduces its counter-tariﬀs, while Canada removes them. Although uncertainty declines somewhat, it persists due to lingering concerns about the stability of US trade policy (see the Scenario assumptions section). Economic growth in Canada rebounds over the second half of 2025. It then eases to a more moderate pace over the rest of the scenario horizon. GDP growth is stronger than in the current tariﬀ scenario because the removal of tariﬀs and reduced uncertainty lead to stronger growth in exports and domestic demand. The level of GDP is roughly 0.5% higher at the end of the scenario horizon. Consumer price index (CPI) inﬂation stays below the 2% target until late 2026. It then averages around 2% in 2027. Inﬂation in 2026 is lower than in the current tariﬀ scenario because tariﬀs are lifted. 47"

In emerging market and developing economies, primary fiscal deficits are projected to widen in 2025 by 0.3 percentage point on average, followed by fiscal tightening starting in 2026. In China, the structural-fiscal-balance-to-GDP ratio is expected to deteriorate by 1.2 percentage points in 2025. Public debt in emerging market and devel- oping economies continues to rise from its current level of 70 percent of GDP , reaching a projected 83 percent in 2030. • Trade policy assumptions: ◦ Tariff announcements between February 1 and April 4, with specific details on their implemen- tation, are included in the reference forecast. On February 1, executive orders signed by US President Donald J. T rump imposed tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico. An additional tariff of 10 percent on all imports from China came into effect on February 4, and another 10 percent was imposed on March 4. China responded with tariffs of 10 to 15 percent on imports of select US agricultural products, energy commodities, and farm equipment, which took effect on February 10, and on imports of agricultural prod- ucts, which took effect on March 10. Tariffs of 25 percent on all nonenergy goods imports from Canada (for energy, 10 percent) and of 25 per- cent on all imports from Mexico took effect on March 4, with the exemption of goods compliant with the United States–Mexico–Canada Agree- ment (USMCA). Canada announced 25 percent countertariffs on roughly 40 percent of Canadian imports of goods from the United States. Mexico indicated the intention to respond without specifying the measures to be employed, hence the reference forecast includes no additional tariff imposed on Mexican imports from the United States. The United States also expanded tariffs on steel and aluminum, effective March 12, remov- ing all exemptions to the 25 percent tariff on steel imports and increasing the tariff rate on alumi- num from 10 to 25 percent. On March 26, the United States announced a 25 percent tariff on all automobiles and auto parts, excluding US content in auto and auto parts exports. This tariff came into effect on April 3 for autos, while implemen- tation for auto parts was postponed to May 3. The US Fair and Reciprocal Plan was introduced on April 2, imposing a 10 percent minimum tar- iff on all countries other than Canada and Mexico and country-specific rates as high as 50 percent for roughly 60 countries. The universal 10 percent minimum tariff took effect on April 5, and the other tariffs were set to take effect on April 9. Exemptions applied to categories of goods deemed critical, such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, energy, and certain minerals. Countermeasures from Canada, announced on April 3, consisted of 25 percent tariffs on non-USMCA-compliant fully assembled vehicles imported from the United States. On April 4, China announced 34 percent tariffs, matching the increase in US duties on imports from China, to take effect on April 10. ◦ Under the reference forecast, trade policy uncer- tainty is assumed to remain elevated through 2025 and 2026. The perceived unpredictability of the current trade landscape is evident from the significant spike in the daily trade policy indicator (Caldara and others 2020), which surged more than four standard deviations in just three days after April 2, despite the disclosure of the details of the expected tariffs.

    "question": "What happened to Canadas inflation in June 2025 after the carbon tax was removed?",
    "retrieved_contexts": [
      "Inflation CPI inﬂation was 1.9% in June, pulled down by the impact of the removal of the consumer carbon tax. CPI inﬂation excluding indirect taxes was 2.5% in June, up from around 2.0% in the second half of 2024 ( Chart 6). CPI inﬂation excluding indirect taxes is being held up primarily by high inﬂation in prices for shelter services. But the rise in inﬂation excluding indirect taxes since late 2024 is mainly due to a pick-up in prices for non-energy goods ( Chart 7), which has more than oﬀset the continued easing of inﬂation in shelter services. Prices for non-energy goods are being pushed up partly by some temporary factors, such as the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar. Chart 6: CPI inflation excluding indirect taxes has picked up since the fourth quarter of 2024 Year-over-year percentage change, monthly data 4.0% 3.5% 3.0% 2.5% 2.0% 1.5% 1.0% 0.5% 0% Jan 2024 Apr 2024 Jul 2024 Oct 2024 Jan 2025 Apr 2025 Total CPI Total CPI excluding indirect taxes Target Sources: Statistics Canada and Bank of Canada calculations Last observation: June 2025 10\n\nA summary of economic conditions Consumer price index (CPI) inﬂation was 1.9% in June. Changes in indirect taxes, such as the HST/GST holiday and the removal of the consumer carbon tax, have impacted CPI inﬂation since late 2024. When indirect taxes are excluded, inﬂation rose to 2.5% in June 2025 from around 2% in the second half of 2024. This increase was mainly because inﬂation in non-energy goods prices rose, more than oﬀsetting an easing in inﬂation in shelter services prices. Similarly, most measures of core inﬂation have picked up since late 2024. Overall, underlying inﬂation is now assessed to be around 2½%. Growth in the Canadian economy in the ﬁrst quarter of 2025 was stronger than expected at 2.2%, largely due to a temporary surge in exports in anticipation of US tariﬀs. Growth is estimated to have contracted in the second quarter. While exports and business investment have fallen, growth in consumer spending has been resilient, and spending by government has picked up. In the current tariﬀ scenario, Canada’s economic growth is modest at 1% in the second half of 2025. Growth then rises, reaching 1.8% in 2027 as the eﬀects of trade policy uncertainty fade and as global demand and exports increase modestly. Inﬂation remains close to 2% throughout the scenario horizon. The upside pressures and the downside pressures on inﬂation are roughly oﬀsetting and dissipate over time. In the de-escalation scenario, growth is stronger, excess supply is reduced and the direct upward pressure on inﬂation from tariﬀs is lower. In the escalation scenario, the Canadian economy contracts through the rest of 2025 and inﬂation rises temporarily above the 2% target due to the direct cost pressures from tariﬀs. 2\n\nNote: The heatmap shows the distance of each CPI component’s year-over-year inflation rate from its historical average. The colour is white when a component’s inflation rate is close to its average and is a varying shade of blue (red) when the rate is below (above) the average. Because the historical range of inflation varies widely across CPI components, each inflation rate plotted in the heatmap is standardized by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation. This standardization is conducted using data from 1996– 2019, except for Regulation-affected services and Other services, where available data begin in 2004 and 2008, respectively. Note that Regulation-affected services includes prices that are affected by government regulations either directly (e.g., child care services) or indirectly (e.g., telephone services). Values in parentheses are CPI weights (in percent). Due to rounding, weights within categories may not sum to their respective totals. The components include the temporary GST/HST holiday (December 14, 2024, to February 15, 2025). This tax change impacts a wide range of goods and services, particularly semi- durable goods and food services. The components also include the removal of the consumer carbon tax (April 1, 2025). Sources: Statistics Canada and Bank of Canada calculations Last observation: June 2025 While tariﬀs and counter-tariﬀs have had only a limited direct eﬀect on inﬂation to date, Canadian businesses indicate that adapting to the changing global trade environment is adding to their costs. Measures of core inﬂation have risen from 2024 and range between 2.5% and 3.0%. The distribution of inﬂation rates across CPI components has shifted somewhat higher, with more rising above 3% and fewer below 1%. Overall, underlying inﬂation is estimated to be about 2½%. Non-energy goods inﬂation has continued to rise Energy prices declined considerably when the consumer carbon tax was removed (see In focus: How removing the consumer carbon tax aﬀ ects inﬂation in the April Report). Inﬂation in energy prices fell to -9.5% in June. Inﬂation in prices for goods excluding energy has increased to 2.2% from about zero in the second half of 2024, above its historical average ( Chart 8). This rise is primarily attributed to the pass-through of past increases in import costs across a broad range of products, from motor vehicles and furniture to clothing and coﬀee. These increases in import costs reﬂect: the depreciation of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar in late 2024, which made imports more expensive past elevated growth in container shipping costs past increases in agricultural prices 12\n\nThe outlook for CPI inﬂation is around 0.4 percentage points lower in 2025. This is primarily due to lower oil prices and the temporary decline in inﬂation from removing the consumer carbon tax, which outweigh the one-time price increase from Canada’s counter-tariﬀs.

Inﬂation is lower than in the current tariﬀ scenario due to the elimination of tariﬀs, which more than oﬀsets the impact of stronger growth and higher energy prices. Inﬂation starts to rise toward 2% in the middle of 2026 because excess supply is slowly absorbed and the removal of the consumer carbon tax no longer aﬀects inﬂation (Chart 28). In 2027, inﬂation is close to 2%.

      "Factors leading to higher inﬂation include: the end of the downward impact from the elimination of the consumer carbon tax in the second quarter of 2026 Canada’s counter-tariﬀs, which add up to 0.6 percentage points to inﬂation, particularly aﬀecting the prices of goods such as food and motor vehicles In addition, businesses report that they are facing new costs due to the reconﬁguration of trade, including the cost of ﬁnding new markets and restructuring their supply chains. These cost pressures are particularly diﬃcult to assess, and there is a risk that they will be more signiﬁcant than anticipated. Factors leading to lower inﬂation include: excess supply and slower growth in unit labour costs easing inﬂation in shelter prices, reﬂecting slower growth in rent prices and mortgage interest costs the recent appreciation of the Canadian dollar In 2027, inﬂation remains close to 2% as the eﬀects of tariﬀs dissipate and excess supply begins to shrink. The composition of inﬂation shifts, with inﬂation in goods prices easing and inﬂation in services prices stabilizing near historical norms. Comparison of recent Bank outlooks Chart 18 compares the current tariﬀ scenario with the January Report and previous Reports. In January, the near-term outlook for inﬂation was higher than in the current tariﬀ scenario because the consumer carbon tax was still in place. The April Report is excluded because it presented a range of scenarios.

GDP growth is approximately 0.5 percentage points lower in both 2025 and 2026 due to the negative eﬀect of tariﬀs and associated uncertainty. Potential output is weaker by the end of 2026 because tariﬀs and uncertainty lead to lower trend labour productivity. 31\n\nNote: The heatmap shows the distance of each CPI component’s year-over-year inflation rate from its historical average. The colour is white when a component’s inflation rate is close to its average and is a varying shade of blue (red) when the rate is below (above) the average. Because the historical range of inflation varies widely across CPI components, each inflation rate plotted in the heatmap is standardized by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation. This standardization is conducted using data from 1996– 2019, except for Regulation-affected services and Other services, where available data begin in 2004 and 2008, respectively. Note that Regulation-affected services includes prices that are affected by government regulations either directly (e.g., child care services) or indirectly (e.g., telephone services). Values in parentheses are CPI weights (in percent). Due to rounding, weights within categories may not sum to their respective totals. The components include the temporary GST/HST holiday (December 14, 2024, to February 15, 2025). This tax change impacts a wide range of goods and services, particularly semi- durable goods and food services. The components also include the removal of the consumer carbon tax (April 1, 2025). Sources: Statistics Canada and Bank of Canada calculations Last observation: June 2025 While tariﬀs and counter-tariﬀs have had only a limited direct eﬀect on inﬂation to date, Canadian businesses indicate that adapting to the changing global trade environment is adding to their costs. Measures of core inﬂation have risen from 2024 and range between 2.5% and 3.0%. The distribution of inﬂation rates across CPI components has shifted somewhat higher, with more rising above 3% and fewer below 1%. Overall, underlying inﬂation is estimated to be about 2½%. Non-energy goods inﬂation has continued to rise Energy prices declined considerably when the consumer carbon tax was removed (see In focus: How removing the consumer carbon tax aﬀ ects inﬂation in the April Report). Inﬂation in energy prices fell to -9.5% in June. Inﬂation in prices for goods excluding energy has increased to 2.2% from about zero in the second half of 2024, above its historical average ( Chart 8). This rise is primarily attributed to the pass-through of past increases in import costs across a broad range of products, from motor vehicles and furniture to clothing and coﬀee. These increases in import costs reﬂect: the depreciation of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar in late 2024, which made imports more expensive past elevated growth in container shipping costs past increases in agricultural prices 12\n\nA summary of economic conditions Consumer price index (CPI) inﬂation was 1.9% in June. Changes in indirect taxes, such as the HST/GST holiday and the removal of the consumer carbon tax, have impacted CPI inﬂation since late 2024. When indirect taxes are excluded, inﬂation rose to 2.5% in June 2025 from around 2% in the second half of 2024. This increase was mainly because inﬂation in non-energy goods prices rose, more than oﬀsetting an easing in inﬂation in shelter services prices. Similarly, most measures of core inﬂation have picked up since late 2024. Overall, underlying inﬂation is now assessed to be around 2½%. Growth in the Canadian economy in the ﬁrst quarter of 2025 was stronger than expected at 2.2%, largely due to a temporary surge in exports in anticipation of US tariﬀs. Growth is estimated to have contracted in the second quarter. While exports and business investment have fallen, growth in consumer spending has been resilient, and spending by government has picked up. In the current tariﬀ scenario, Canada’s economic growth is modest at 1% in the second half of 2025. Growth then rises, reaching 1.8% in 2027 as the eﬀects of trade policy uncertainty fade and as global demand and exports increase modestly. Inﬂation remains close to 2% throughout the scenario horizon. The upside pressures and the downside pressures on inﬂation are roughly oﬀsetting and dissipate over time. In the de-escalation scenario, growth is stronger, excess supply is reduced and the direct upward pressure on inﬂation from tariﬀs is lower. In the escalation scenario, the Canadian economy contracts through the rest of 2025 and inﬂation rises temporarily above the 2% target due to the direct cost pressures from tariﬀs. 2\n\nFour Years in Review and the Years Ahead | 83 The forecast jumps off from a 4.1 percent unemployment rate in October 2024, which is slightly higher than the Administration’s estimate of the 3.8 percent rate consistent with stable inflation. As a result, with real output forecasted to grow 2.1 percent during the four quarters of 2025, slightly faster than the potential GDP growth rate, the unemployment rate edges down to 3.8 percent by the end of the year without an increase in inflation. In comparison, the Blue Chip consensus panel expects a slightly lower real GDP growth rate of 1.9 percent. Many other forces will be at work during 2025. In this particular forecast, a glide path of fiscal consoli- dation is assumed and the legacy of tight monetary policy still restrains the growth rate of investment and consumer spending. After the unemployment rate falls by the end of 2025 to 3.8 percent, the rate consistent with stable inflation, it is expected to remain there for the rest of the forecast interval, consistent with GDP growing at its potential growth rate. After falling dramatically from 7.1 percent in 2022 to 3.2 percent in 2023 (Q4 to Q4 changes), CPI inflation appears on track to fall further to 2.6 percent during the four quarters of 2024. The Administration expects CPI inflation to fall slightly further during 2025 to 2.3 percent, a rate that is consistent with the Federal Reserve’s 2.0 percent target for the PCE Price Index. CPI inflation tends to run higher than PCE inflation; over the 45 years through 2023, CPI inflation exceeded PCE inflation by 0.3 percentage point.25 The price index for GDP—a measure of inflation for everything produced in the United States—is expected to fall from a forecasted 2.4 percent during 2024 to 2.2 percent during 2025. In response to an increase in inflation, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate in 2022 and 2023, then let it plateau at roughly 5.3 percent for more than a year. Following evidence of a decline in inflation, the FOMC took the first step down from that plateau in September 2024 and another step in November. The three-month Treasury bill (T-bill) rate also fell around the same time. Looking ahead, as inflation settles near the FOMC’s target, further declines in T-bill rates are expected by private professional forecasters, the FOMC, and the Administration, with the caveat that the FOMC’s future rate cuts will be data dependent. After adjusting for 2 per- cent expected PCE inflation, the real rate on three-month T-bills is expected to be about 0.9 percent. With respect to the long end of interest rate forecasts, the Administration expects the yield on 10-year Treasury notes to edge down slightly from an expected 4.2 percent average during 2024 to 3.8 percent by 2028 and then remain there for the rest of the 11-year forecast interval. In principle, the cur- rent 10-year yield should be the expected average yield on the three-month T-bill during the next 10 years, plus a term premium. From this perspective, 25 This calculation uses the retroactive series from the BLS: R-CPI-U-RS.\n\nChart 23: US inflation picked up in June US consumer price index, year-over-year percentage change, monthly data 2.2% 2.4% 2.6% 2.8% 3.0% 3.2% 3.4% Jul 2024 Sep 2024 Nov 2024 Jan 2025 Mar 2025 May 2025 Total Excluding food and energy Source: US Bureau of Labor Statistics via Haver Analytics Last observation: June 2025 Wage growth has been solid and, given robust labour productivity growth, remains consistent with the Federal Reserve’s 2% inﬂation target. Interest rates are restraining demand and putting downward pressure on inﬂation. Tariﬀs continue to weigh on US growth In the scenario, tariﬀs and uncertainty weigh on US economic activity. The increase in tariﬀs permanently reduces the path for the level of GDP. GDP growth picks up modestly to about 2¼% on average in 2026 and 2027. Growth in consumption spending slows meaningfully in 2026 because tariﬀ-driven inﬂation erodes income gains and policy uncertainty weighs on consumer conﬁdence. Expansionary ﬁscal policy and an easing in monetary policy provide partial oﬀsets. Consumption recovers in 2027, supported by real wage growth and the diminishing eﬀects of uncertainty. Business investment growth is restrained by tariﬀs and ongoing uncertainty. The rollout of AI- related spending provides a boost in the near term. Export growth picks up modestly in 2026 and 2027 due to improving global demand and the depreciation of the US dollar. Imports fall sharply in response to tariﬀs before recovering in 2027. US inﬂation picks up and peaks close to 3% at the end of 2025 as the impact of tariﬀs takes hold and the eﬀect from past declines in the price of oil fades. It then moderates as the impact from tariﬀs dissipates. 39"

CPI inﬂation excluding indirect taxes was 2.5% in June, up from around 2.0% in the second half of 2024 ( Chart 6). CPI inﬂation excluding indirect taxes is being held up primarily by high inﬂation in prices for shelter services. But the rise in inﬂation excluding indirect taxes since late 2024 is mainly due to a pick-up in prices for non-energy goods ( Chart 7), which has more than oﬀset the continued easing of inﬂation in shelter services. Prices for non-energy goods are being pushed up partly by some temporary factors, such as the past depreciation of the Canadian dollar.

In contrast, Canadian businesses have indicated that adapting to the evolving global trade environment is already adding to their costs. These cost pressures may persist. Services price inﬂation has eased modestly Inﬂation in services prices was 3% in June, 0.5 percentage points lower than in the second half of 2024. While shelter price inﬂation remains above its historical average (Chart 9), it has continued to gradually decline: Rent inﬂation has eased since the start of 2025 and was 4.7% in June, likely reﬂecting increasing rental supply and slowing population growth. Growth in mortgage interest cost slowed to 5.6%. 13\n\nThe outlook for CPI inﬂation is around 0.4 percentage points lower in 2025. This is primarily due to lower oil prices and the temporary decline in inﬂation from removing the consumer carbon tax, which outweigh the one-time price increase from Canada’s counter-tariﬀs.

    "retrieved_contexts": [
      "56 | Chapter 1 To better understand the drivers of inflation and disinflation over the past four years, figure 1-20 displays contributions to headline inflation from five components: food, energy, housing, core goods (excluding food and energy), and core non-housing services (excluding housing and energy). Core goods (21.8 percent weight in PCE market basket). 8 Core goods prices were a strong contributor to both sides of inflation’s round trip, as strong demand met constrained supply. As goods spending intensified while services spending remained below pre-pandemic levels, core goods inflation increased quickly relative to other categories, from a pre-pandemic baseline of nearly zero. At its peak in February 2022—four months before headline PCE inflation peaked—core goods inflation contributed nearly 2 percentage points to overall inflation. Disinflation took hold as supply chains normal - ized (see figure 1-19), and by November 2023, yearly core goods inflation was nearly zero. From December 2023 to October 2024, core goods prices contributed negatively to yearly inflation. Core services excluding housing (51.4 percent). Prices of core services excluding housing accelerated quickly in 2021. Following widespread vac- cination against COVID-19, pent-up demand for in-person services met heavily constrained supply. Rising labor costs amid a tight labor market added upward price pressures, and inflation in this category remained above 4 percent from May 2021 through September 2023. Core services excluding housing account for about half of the PCE market basket, and as figure 1-21 shows, their outsized contribution to headline inflation stands out in histori- cal context. By October 2024, the category had seen nearly 2 percentage points of disinflation from its peak of 5.3 percent. Food (7.5 percent). Grocery prices began to rise early in the pandemic, as demand for food at home grew while the pandemic affected food process- ing facilities and grocery supply chains (Aday and Aday 2020). Food com- modity price shocks caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine worsened the problem, and food inflation was elevated throughout 2022, peaking above 12 percent in August 2022 (Aizenman et al. 2024). Because groceries make up about 9 percent of the typical American household’s spending, price increases deeply affected families.9 Grocery inflation cooled substantially in 2023 and 2024, and because wage growth outpaced grocery price growth, groceries were less expensive in real terms in October 2024 than in 2019 (CEA 2024c). Energy (3.6 percent). Energy inflation spiked in 2021 and remained elevated throughout 2022 after pandemic-related disruptions left supply unable to keep up with demand. Crude oil prices rose in early 2022 following 8 PCE weights reflect nominal expenditure share for each category in the October 2024 Personal Income Report. 9 According to the 2023 Consumer Expenditure Survey, households in the third quintile of pre-tax income spent 8.8 percent of their total annual expenditures on groceries.\n\nChart 10: Core inflation has risen since late 2024 Year-over-year percentage change, monthly data -2% 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 CPI excluding indirect taxes Range of core measures Note: Core measures included are CPI-trim, CPI-median, CPIX and CPIXFET. CPI-trim excludes CPI components whose rates of change in a given month are located in the tails of the distribution of price changes. CPI-median is a measure of core inflation corresponding to the price change located at the 50th percentile. CPIX excludes eight of the most volatile components of inflation. CPIXFET excludes food and energy inflation. All measures exclude the effect of indirect taxes. Sources: Statistics Canada and Bank of Canada calculations Last observation: June 2025 The share of CPI components rising by more than 3% year-over-year has moved up and is above its historical average (Chart 11). The share running below 1% has fallen and is now close to its historical average. This pattern of price growth is typically associated with inﬂation of around 2½%. Based on all these measures, the Bank of Canada assesses underlying inﬂation to be about 2½%. 15\n\n8 THE BUDGET AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: 2025 TO 2035 JANUAry 2025 Overall Inflation and Core Inflation CBO expects the growth of overall prices to slow further in 2025, to a rate close to the Federal Reserve’s long-run goal of 2 percent. In CBO’s projections, inflation as measured by the PCE price index (the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure) falls from 2.5 percent in 2024 to 2.2 percent in 2025, reflecting moderating demand for labor and slower growth in housing costs. Inflation then declines more gradually, reaching 2.1 percent in 2026. From 2027 to 2035, it averages 2.0 percent per year. Outlook for Inflation and Interest Rates Inflation slows in 2025 and settles at 2% or less after 2026. After 2025, short-term interest rates remain below 10-year rates, reflecting their typical relationship.

Core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy, peaked at 5.6 percent in February 2022 and was 2.8 percent as of October 2024. Supply Chain Disruptions In March 2021, inventory-to-sales ratios in both the retail sector and overall economy hit record lows, with inventory shortages hampering business activity in sectors like homebuilding, and semiconductor shortages dev- astating the market for new and used vehicles (Helper and Soltas 2021). Global supply chain disruptions caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine further contributed to rising prices in advanced economies, led by food and energy price shocks (Aizenman et al. 2024; Tong 2024). Figure 1-19 shows that supplier delivery lag times, one measure of supply chain pressures, lengthened during the pandemic. Movements in supplier delivery lag times coincided with the rise and fall of core goods prices. Unsnarling supply chains was critical to restoring the balance between supply and demand.

But critically, most Canadian exports continue to cross the border duty-free thanks to CUSMA exemptions, and weakness remains largely contained to directly impacted sectors. Employment in manufacturing and transportation sectors are down 32,000 from the end of 2024, but up 70,000 in other industries.

Net trade likely won’t repeat its Q2 decline, household spending has continued to surprise on the upside, and fiscal support (better suited to address sector-specific tariff headwinds) is increasing. However, weak Q2 GDP and recent labour market reports makes a September rate cut essentially a toss-up. Some downside risks remain U.S. dependency risks: Canada maintains relatively favorable U.S. tariff rates, but that provides little comfort if broader U.S. tariff hikes cause the tightly integrated North American industrial sector to shrink.

Maintaining CUSMA exemption is critical on both sides of the border: The CUSMA exemption continues to protect most Canadian exports from U.S. tariffs, and maintaining it is vital for Canadian exporters. But, as we argued here, the agreement is also important for U.S. importers, who would see already escalating import costs accelerate significantly without it. CUSMA doesn’t (automatically) expire until 2036, and negotiations to extend the agreement (negotiated by the first Trump administration) beyond that time start next year at the latest. U.S. trade policy remains highly unpredictable, but the continuation of CUSMA protections through multiple rounds of U.S. tariffs is an implicit recognition of its mutual benefits. RBC Economics | thoughtleadership.rbc.com/economics QUARTERLY CANADIAN OUTLOOK | September 15, 2025RBC Economics\n\nProvincial overview Provincial growth diverges amid trade tensions While Canada faces a national shock from its trade relationship with the United States, the provinces are facing differentiated trade shocks that are creating divergences in both growth and growth drivers. First, the doubling of U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%, and newly added tariffs on copper of 50% has prompted further downgrades of our 2025 growth forecasts for: Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba. Second, heightened duties on lumber exports—which are compounding existing challenges of investment weakness—implies a lower growth projection for British Columbia as well. Third, while all eyes are on U.S. tariffs, Chinese tariffs are also in play. Seafood tariffs had already been incorporated into earlier projections, and therefore haven’t altered the better-than-national average growth outlook for Atlantic provinces. Chinese canola tariffs in effect from August were implemented too late in the 2025 growing season to impact our gross domestic product outlook for the Prairies this year. We will, however, monitor trade negotiations closely as they unfold over the next six months, and may adjust our 2026 forecasts depending on outcomes.

After that, export growth resumes as Canadian exporters adjust to the new trade environment. Imports decline until the ﬁrst quarter of 2026 as counter-tariﬀs and weak business investment reduce demand for inputs from abroad. Import growth then picks up, supported by growth in domestic demand. Domestic demand moderates due to trade pressures The intensifying global conﬂict slows growth in ﬁnal domestic demand in Canada. Household purchasing power weakens because of deteriorating labour market conditions. Less demand from the United States causes some exporters to reduce hours and lay oﬀ workers. Additionally, a decline in Canada’s terms of trade weighs on household incomes, and higher tariﬀs raise the prices of imports, such as food and consumer goods. Business investment falls because of higher import costs and reduced demand for capital goods due to lower exports. However, as the trade environment begins to stabilize, investment growth turns positive. 52\n\nOutlook for rest of the year is brighter Positive Factors Meanwhile, activity outside of tariff-affected sectors has been resilient. Consumer spending jumped 4.5% in Q2 despite low confidence. Our tracking of RBC card transactions pointed to further Q3 growth. The unemployment rate reached 7.1% in August—the highest outside the pandemic in nearly a decade—but job openings and improving business confidence suggest hiring demand is stabilizing. In our last quarterly update three months ago, we noted key developments in Canada’s outlook were more positive than anticipated when economic sentiment was lowest in spring. This remains true with growth tracking closer to the least negative scenarios from earlier in the year. Resilient growth: Early Q3 GDP indicators look better than Q2. Export volumes rose for a third consecutive month in July and manufacturing sales increased, suggesting Q3 will not be similar to Q2’s large growth subtraction from trade and manufacturing. Housing markets have shown early signs of improvement, and our tracking of RBC card transactions points to growth ahead in consumer spending. CUSMA exemptions: Most Canadian exports to the U.S. remain tariff-free (88% in July) under exemptions for trade compliant with CUSMA. Outside of petroleum exports (which are down sharply from a year ago largely due to lower oil prices), exports of products specifically targeted by tariffs are down 16% from a year ago in July. However, products that have remained largely duty-free are up 0.5%. Fiscal support: Federal and provincial governments have announced significant economic support packages that are increasingly likely to support growth in the year ahead. Limited layoffs: The unemployment rate rise mostly stems from longer job search times for new entrants. Youth unemployment, in particular, has increased sharply. But growth in unemployed workers due to permanent layoffs has slowed to 4.7% year-over-year in August, down from 19% and 24% in 2023 and 2024, respectively.

RBC Economics | thoughtleadership.rbc.com/economics QUARTERLY CANADIAN OUTLOOK | September 15, 2025RBC Economics\n\nAssumptions common to all three scenarios Tariﬀs are assumed to be permanent and to reduce TFP and investment. In Canada, half of the revenues from tariﬀs are remitted to businesses aﬀected by tariﬀs in line with Government of Canada announcements. Remaining tariﬀ revenues are redistributed to households. In all other countries, half of the revenues from tariﬀs are redistributed to households, while the rest is added to general revenues. In most countries, three-quarters of the increased costs from tariﬀs are passed through to consumer prices within six quarters. In the United States, tariﬀs are assumed to pass through to goods prices in roughly three quarters. The United States is the only country to impose tariﬀs on all its trading partners, increasing the cost of imports from all countries. Therefore, businesses do not need to worry about cheaper substitutes and can pass on tariﬀ-related cost increases more quickly. The scenarios incorporate information from published provincial budgets and recent federal ﬁscal measures that have been tabled at the time of writing.2 Major program measures include: the enactment of a federal government tax cut on July 1, 2025 increases in federal defence spending announced on June 9, 2025 The rate of population growth of people aged 15 and over in Canada is assumed to slow from 3.3% in 2024 to 1.3% in 2025 and then to moderate further to 0.5% in 2026. Population growth is assumed to be 0.6% in 2027. Because it is still too early to assess, the impact from a reduction in interprovincial trade barriers on potential output has not been included in the scenarios. The nominal neutral interest rate in Canada is estimated to be in the range of 2.25% to 3.25%. Endnotes 1. These assumptions are informed by the latest trade statistics and discussions with Canadian businesses.[←] 2. By convention, ﬁscal measures and updates are typically incorporated if they have been tabled at the time of writing.[←] 25\n\nCurrent tariff scenario The current tariﬀ scenario assumes the following tariﬀs are in place. US tariﬀ measures on Canada: a 50% tariﬀ on imports of steel and aluminum a 25% tariﬀ on the non-US content of imported motor vehicles a 25% tariﬀ on motor vehicle parts that do not comply with the Canada-United States- Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) a 25% tariﬀ on imported goods that do not comply with CUSMA (a 10% tariﬀ on energy or potash products), other than on motor vehicles and parts CUSMA-compliance is assumed to be: 100% for energy exports 95% for all other goods exports1 Canada’s retaliatory tariﬀs on the United States: a 25% tariﬀ on approximately $60 billion of imports of US goods a 25% tariﬀ on the US content of vehicles imported from the United States with exceptions for CUSMA-compliant components made in Canada and Mexico United States measures on countries other than Canada: a tariﬀ of at least 50% on imports of steel, aluminum and certain related household appliances a tariﬀ of at least 25% on the non-US content of imported motor vehicles and parts, with lower tariﬀ rates for the European Union, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom, as established in their trade agreements an increase in tariﬀs of 28 percentage points on goods from China compared with the start of 2025, representing both bilateral and sectoral tariﬀs an increase in tariﬀs of 9 percentage points on average on countries outside of Canada and China compared with the start of 2025 China’s retaliatory tariﬀs on the United States: an increase in tariﬀs on US goods equivalent to 13 percentage points China’s retaliatory tariﬀs on Canada: 100% on some agricultural products and 25% on pork and seafood products Other countries: no retaliatory tariﬀs imposed Other key assumptions include: Trade policy uncertainty remains elevated around the world into 2026 Trade tensions reduce total factor productivity (TFP) and investment, lowering the level of Canadian potential output by 0.5% in 2027 Global potential output is lower by 0.1% in 2027 Over the scenario horizon, the per-barrel prices for oil are assumed to be US$65 for Brent, US$60 for West Texas Intermediate and US$50 for Western Canadian Select The Canadian dollar is assumed to average 73 cents US over the scenario 22\n\nThe path of US tariffs remains uncertain Because the trade environment remains so uncertain, the path for Canadian growth and inﬂation is less clear than usual. If the trade conﬂict were to escalate or de- escalate, those shifts would alter economic outcomes. Since January, the United States has threatened, imposed, paused and reinstated tariﬀs on many of its trading partners. It has negotiated agreements with some countries, but many others still face threats of signiﬁcant new tariﬀs. These policy shifts have happened quickly and sometimes without warning. As a result, this Report presents a current tariﬀ scenario instead of a base-case projection as well as two alternative scenarios—a de-escalation scenario and an escalation scenario. When taken together, these scenarios encompass a range of potential outcomes. The current tariﬀ scenario is presented in the Outlook and Global economy sections. This section presents the de-escalation and escalation scenarios. In the de-escalation scenario, tariﬀs are lower than in the current tariﬀ scenario, and the degree of trade uncertainty decreases. Compared with the current tariﬀ scenario: economic growth in Canada rebounds faster once tariﬀs are reduced and uncertainty eases inﬂation in Canada is lower over most of the scenario horizon, primarily because tariﬀs are lifted In the escalation scenario, trade negotiations deteriorate, causing tariﬀs to rise signiﬁcantly. Compared with the current tariﬀ scenario: economic growth in Canada slows markedly, with gross domestic product (GDP) about 1.25% lower by the end of the scenario horizon inﬂation rises faster, because of the increase in tariﬀs, to around 2.5% in 2026, before stabilizing around 2% in 2027 De-escalation scenario In this scenario, the United States lowers its tariﬀs against Canada and other countries. In response, China signiﬁcantly reduces its counter-tariﬀs, while Canada removes them. Although uncertainty declines somewhat, it persists due to lingering concerns about the stability of US trade policy (see the Scenario assumptions section). Economic growth in Canada rebounds over the second half of 2025. It then eases to a more moderate pace over the rest of the scenario horizon. GDP growth is stronger than in the current tariﬀ scenario because the removal of tariﬀs and reduced uncertainty lead to stronger growth in exports and domestic demand. The level of GDP is roughly 0.5% higher at the end of the scenario horizon. Consumer price index (CPI) inﬂation stays below the 2% target until late 2026. It then averages around 2% in 2027. Inﬂation in 2026 is lower than in the current tariﬀ scenario because tariﬀs are lifted. 47"

      "10  FINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE IN UNCERTAIN TIMES © OECD 2025 4. Additional increases in US bilateral tariff rates on almost all trading partners since mid -May have raised the (ex-ante) effective tariff rate on US merchandise imports to an estimated 19.5% as of end-August (using 2024 -based weights) (Figure 4, Panel A) . This is the highest tariff rate since 1933 and 4.1 percentage points higher than the rate in mid-May (used in the June OECD Economic Outlook). At the sectoral level, US tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports have been raised by an additional 25 percentage points and tariffs on all copper imports by 50 percentage points. New bilateral agreements covering tariffs , investment and other areas of cooperation have been concluded with some countries since May, including the European Union, Japan and Indonesia, reducing the tariff rates being applied on some items. Amongst the G20, China, India and Brazil face the highest increases in bilateral US tariff rates this year. Ongoing legal challenges and negotiations, and the risk of new tariffs on currently-exempt items, add to uncertainty about trade policies. Newspaper-based measures of trade policy uncertainty have moderated since April 2025, but remain high by historical standards. 5. The impacts of higher tariff rates are yet to be fully felt in the US economy. This reflects a combination of factors, with firms making use of inventories and ample profit margins to avoid or absorb the initial impact of higher tariffs, lags between the announcement and imposition of higher tariff rates, and the exemption of goods already in transit from higher tariff rates. At the margins, there are also some signs of reduced purchases of goods subject to higher tariff increases (Figure 4, Panel D). Observed (ex-post) monthly tariff rates calculated from United States revenue and trade statistics (reported customs duties divided by the value of merchandise imports) have risen sharply this year, but lag estimated effective tariff rates (Figure 4, Panel B), portending an increase in tariff collection in the coming months. 6. There are already some signs that tariffs have begun to be passed through into consumer prices, notably durable goods with a high import content (Figure 4, Panel C). Recent business surveys also suggest that continued increases in manufacturing input prices in the United States are being passed through to output prices . There are few indications from import price data that foreign companies have sought to offset higher US tariffs in the prices of exports to the United States, with one notable exception being the lower price of passenger car exports from Japan.\n\nCHAPTER 1 GLOBAL PROSPECTS AND POLICIES 33International Monetary Fund | April 2025 fully pass higher import costs through to consumers. Both assumptions cause the tariff increases to result in higher inflationary pressures in the United States. Figure 1.2.1 shows the impact across the three ver- sions of GIMF (the standard specification plus the two alternative versions) for bilateral real exchange rates with respect to the United States, for inflation, and for GDP . Results are shown in deviations from a no- tariff baseline for the world, the United States, China, Canada and Mexico combined (CMX in the figure), the euro area, and other Asian countries. Currencies. Higher tariffs lead to a depreciation of currencies with respect to the dollar (Figure 1.2.1, panel 1). The euro area and Other Asia experience the largest depreciations. The yuan depreciates by less relative to others on account of the exchange rate management assumption. Exchange rate movements are considerably smaller if tariff increases are perceived as temporary, about one-third the size relative to the version of the model in which tariffs are perceived as permanent. Inflation. The impact on inflation is uncertain (Figure 1.2.1, panel 2). In the first version, the effect is limited, except in China, which experiences a decrease of about 60 basis points in 2026 because of the man- aged exchange rate. Inflationary effects in the United States are offset by the appreciation of the dollar and some decline in markups. When tariffs are perceived to be temporary and import costs are fully passed on, US inflation increases by close to 50 basis points in 2025. The impact on inflation outside the United States is instead larger if the dollar plays a central role in the pricing of global trade, as the appreciation of the dollar raises production costs globally. Activity. Tariffs have a large negative impact on global activity. The effect is largest for Canada and Mexico, China, and the United States (Figure 1.2.1, panel 3). The impact on China also reflects a less-than- full adjustment of the exchange rate. The negative impact on the United States is amplified in the version of GIMF in which tariffs are perceived to be tempo- rary and import costs are fully passed on, because the resulting increase in inflation leads to a tightening of monetary policy.

The April 2 Rose Garden announcement forced us to jettison our projections— nearly finalized at that point—and compress a produc- tion cycle that usually takes more than two months into less than 10 days. Shortly after the January 2025 WEO Update, the United States announced multiple waves of tariffs on major trading partners and critical sectors, culminating on April 2 with a set of nearly universal tariffs. While many of the scheduled tariff increases are on hold for now, the combination of measures and countermeasures has hiked US and global tariff rates to centennial highs. However, the context for such increases is very different. Unlike in the previous century, the global economy is now characterized by a high degree of economic and financial integration, with supply chains and financial flows crisscrossing the world, whose potential unwinding could constitute a major source of economic upheaval. For this reason, we expect that the sharp increase on April 2 in both tariffs and uncertainty will lead to a significant slowdown in global growth in the near term. While this is our central scenario—or “reference forecast”—many possible paths exist, reflecting the unpredictability surrounding future trade policy and the varied impact of tariffs across different countries through a diverse set of channels. These are discussed in detail in Chapter 1. The common denominator, however, is that tariffs are a negative supply shock for the economy imposing them, as resources are reallocated toward the production of noncompetitive goods, with a resulting loss of aggre- gate productivity, lower activity, and higher production costs and prices. Moreover, in the medium term, by reducing competition, tariffs increase the market power of domestic producers, decrease incentives to innovate, and create multiple opportunities for rent seeking. For trading partners, tariffs constitute mostly a negative external demand shock, driving foreign customers away from their products, even if some countries could bene- fit from the rerouting of trade flows. These effects are magnified in the presence of modern complex global supply chains. Most traded goods are intermediate inputs that traverse countries multiple times before their transformation into final products. Sectoral disruptions could propagate up and down the global input-output network in ways with poten- tially large multiplier effects, just as we saw during the pandemic. Anticipating such disruptions we have also revised down our projection for global trade growth by 1½ percentage points this year, with a slight recovery penciled in for 2026. The uncertainty around trade policy is also a major factor depressing our outlook. Faced with increased uncertainty about access to markets—their own but also those of their suppliers and customers—many firms’ ini- tial reaction will be to pause, reduce investment, and cut purchases. Likewise, financial institutions will reevaluate their credit supply to businesses, until they can assess the latter’s exposure to the new environment. The com- bined increased uncertainty and resulting tightening of financial conditions are a global negative demand shock and will weigh on activity. This could well dominate in the short term—as reflected in the sharp decline in oil prices. The effect of tariffs on exchange rates is not straight- forward. First, the US, as the tariffing economy, may see its currency appreciate, as happened in previous episodes. This reflects the reduced demand for foreign currency as the demand for imports declines, but also the likelihood that tariffed countries may ease their monetary policy stance to respond to the negative demand shock. However, greater policy uncertainty, lower growth prospects in the US, and an adjustment in the global demand for dollar assets—which has been orderly so\n\nChart 20: The average US tariff rate is the highest it has been in decades US weighted average tariff rate, annual data 0% 10% 20% 40% 30% 1910 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020 Historical tariff rate April 2, 2025 April 10, 2025—Peak US retaliatory tariffs on Chinese goods July 27, 2025—Current tariff scenario Sources: US International Trade Commission and Bank of Canada calculations Last data plotted: July 27, 2025 United States Tariﬀs and uncertainty are weighing on growth of gross domestic product (GDP).

Tariﬀs have dampened US growth US growth slowed in the ﬁrst half of 2025 to around 1% on average from around 2¾% in the second half of 2024. Household spending was held back by uncertainty related to trade and other economic policies ( Chart 21). However, the slowdown was not as severe as it could have been. In particular, domestic demand was relatively resilient, supported by: improved business and consumer conﬁdence and a recovery in US equity markets in recent months investment related to artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) Other factors that supported GDP growth include robust trend productivity growth and solid job creation. In contrast, changes to immigration policy are weighing on labour supply. 36"

      "Assumptions common to all three scenarios Tariﬀs are assumed to be permanent and to reduce TFP and investment. In Canada, half of the revenues from tariﬀs are remitted to businesses aﬀected by tariﬀs in line with Government of Canada announcements. Remaining tariﬀ revenues are redistributed to households. In all other countries, half of the revenues from tariﬀs are redistributed to households, while the rest is added to general revenues. In most countries, three-quarters of the increased costs from tariﬀs are passed through to consumer prices within six quarters. In the United States, tariﬀs are assumed to pass through to goods prices in roughly three quarters. The United States is the only country to impose tariﬀs on all its trading partners, increasing the cost of imports from all countries. Therefore, businesses do not need to worry about cheaper substitutes and can pass on tariﬀ-related cost increases more quickly. The scenarios incorporate information from published provincial budgets and recent federal ﬁscal measures that have been tabled at the time of writing.2 Major program measures include: the enactment of a federal government tax cut on July 1, 2025 increases in federal defence spending announced on June 9, 2025 The rate of population growth of people aged 15 and over in Canada is assumed to slow from 3.3% in 2024 to 1.3% in 2025 and then to moderate further to 0.5% in 2026. Population growth is assumed to be 0.6% in 2027. Because it is still too early to assess, the impact from a reduction in interprovincial trade barriers on potential output has not been included in the scenarios.

Note: The Jan. 20–Apr. 1 tariffs in 2025 include 20 percent tariffs on China; 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum; 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada; and a 10 percent tariff on Canadian energy imports. A United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) carve-out is assumed to halve the effective tariff increase for Canada and Mexico. The April 2 tariffs include auto sector tariffs and country-specific tariffs, applying exemptions provided in Annex II of the Executive Order per IMF staff judgment. The April 9 tariffs include an increase in the tariffs on China to 145 percent and a reduction in other country-specific tariffs to 10 percent.

US tariﬀ measures on Canada: a 50% tariﬀ on imports of steel and aluminum a 25% tariﬀ on the non-US content of imported motor vehicles a 25% tariﬀ on motor vehicle parts that do not comply with the Canada-United States- Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) a 25% tariﬀ on imported goods that do not comply with CUSMA (a 10% tariﬀ on energy or potash products), other than on motor vehicles and parts CUSMA-compliance is assumed to be: 100% for energy exports 95% for all other goods exports1 Canada’s retaliatory tariﬀs on the United States: a 25% tariﬀ on approximately $60 billion of imports of US goods a 25% tariﬀ on the US content of vehicles imported from the United States with exceptions for CUSMA-compliant components made in Canada and Mexico United States measures on countries other than Canada: a tariﬀ of at least 50% on imports of steel, aluminum and certain related household appliances a tariﬀ of at least 25% on the non-US content of imported motor vehicles and parts, with lower tariﬀ rates for the European Union, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom, as established in their trade agreements an increase in tariﬀs of 28 percentage points on goods from China compared with the start of 2025, representing both bilateral and sectoral tariﬀs an increase in tariﬀs of 9 percentage points on average on countries outside of Canada and China compared with the start of 2025 China’s retaliatory tariﬀs on the United States: an increase in tariﬀs on US goods equivalent to 13 percentage points China’s retaliatory tariﬀs on Canada: 100% on some agricultural products and 25% on pork and seafood products Other countries: no retaliatory tariﬀs imposed Other key assumptions include: Trade policy uncertainty remains elevated around the world into 2026 Trade tensions reduce total factor productivity (TFP) and investment, lowering the level of Canadian potential output by 0.5% in 2027 Global potential output is lower by 0.1% in 2027 Over the scenario horizon, the per-barrel prices for oil are assumed to be US$65 for Brent, US$60 for West Texas Intermediate and US$50 for Western Canadian Select The Canadian dollar is assumed to average 73 cents US over the scenario 22\n\nDe-escalation scenario Trade tensions ease. The United States lowers—but does not completely remove—its tariﬀs on other countries. As a result, Canada and other countries lower their retaliatory tariﬀs. Uncertainty decreases but does not disappear. Compared with the current tariﬀ scenario, the United States: halves the level of sectoral tariﬀs (steel and aluminum, motor vehicles and parts) reduces the tariﬀs on Canadian goods that do not comply with CUSMA to 10% from 25% reduces the increase in tariﬀs on Chinese goods from 28 percentage points to 24 percentage points reduces the weighted average increase in tariﬀs on other countries from 9 percentage points to 6 percentage points Canada and other countries react by scaling back countermeasures on the United States: Canada removes its counter-tariﬀs on the United States China reduces the incremental tariﬀ increases imposed on the United States from 13 percentage points in the current tariﬀ scenario to 1 percentage point other countries maintain their policy of not retaliating against the United States Other key assumptions include: Trade policy uncertainty is roughly halved from the level in the current tariﬀ scenario. Potential output in Canada is 0.2% stronger at the end of 2027 compared with the current tariﬀ scenario. Over the scenario horizon, the per-barrel prices for oil are assumed to be US$70 for Brent, US$65 for West Texas Intermediate and US$55 for Western Canadian Select. The Canadian dollar averages 74 cents US over the scenario. Other assumptions remain unchanged. 23\n\nCentral bank flexibility: Additional interest rate cuts from the Bank of Canada aren’t in our base case forecasts, but policymakers can reduce rates if needed. Net trade likely won’t repeat its Q2 decline, household spending has continued to surprise on the upside, and fiscal support (better suited to address sector-specific tariff headwinds) is increasing. However, weak Q2 GDP and recent labour market reports makes a September rate cut essentially a toss-up. Some downside risks remain U.S. dependency risks: Canada maintains relatively favorable U.S. tariff rates, but that provides little comfort if broader U.S. tariff hikes cause the tightly integrated North American industrial sector to shrink. The U.S. unemployment rate remains historically low, but job growth has stalled since April with weakness concentrated in industrial sectors where Canadian economic ties are strongest. Maintaining CUSMA exemption is critical on both sides of the border: The CUSMA exemption continues to protect most Canadian exports from U.S. tariffs, and maintaining it is vital for Canadian exporters. But, as we argued here, the agreement is also important for U.S. importers, who would see already escalating import costs accelerate significantly without it. CUSMA doesn’t (automatically) expire until 2036, and negotiations to extend the agreement (negotiated by the first Trump administration) beyond that time start next year at the latest. U.S. trade policy remains highly unpredictable, but the continuation of CUSMA protections through multiple rounds of U.S. tariffs is an implicit recognition of its mutual benefits.

Potential output growth then picks up in 2026 and 2027, mainly due to more robust trend labour productivity growth. Trend labour input growth remains modest. The output gap persists in 2026 and then narrows in 2027 as GDP growth picks up. Exports rise slowly from current low levels After falling sharply in the second quarter due to tariﬀs, exports stabilize in the second half of 2025. They increase modestly over the rest of the scenario horizon as Canadian exporters adjust to the new trade environment. Non-commodity exports remain well below their pre-tariﬀ levels, reﬂecting the permanent damage done by US tariﬀs ( Chart 16). 28\n\nA summary of economic conditions Consumer price index (CPI) inﬂation was 1.9% in June. Changes in indirect taxes, such as the HST/GST holiday and the removal of the consumer carbon tax, have impacted CPI inﬂation since late 2024. When indirect taxes are excluded, inﬂation rose to 2.5% in June 2025 from around 2% in the second half of 2024. This increase was mainly because inﬂation in non-energy goods prices rose, more than oﬀsetting an easing in inﬂation in shelter services prices. Similarly, most measures of core inﬂation have picked up since late 2024. Overall, underlying inﬂation is now assessed to be around 2½%. Growth in the Canadian economy in the ﬁrst quarter of 2025 was stronger than expected at 2.2%, largely due to a temporary surge in exports in anticipation of US tariﬀs. Growth is estimated to have contracted in the second quarter. While exports and business investment have fallen, growth in consumer spending has been resilient, and spending by government has picked up. In the current tariﬀ scenario, Canada’s economic growth is modest at 1% in the second half of 2025. Growth then rises, reaching 1.8% in 2027 as the eﬀects of trade policy uncertainty fade and as global demand and exports increase modestly. Inﬂation remains close to 2% throughout the scenario horizon. The upside pressures and the downside pressures on inﬂation are roughly oﬀsetting and dissipate over time. In the de-escalation scenario, growth is stronger, excess supply is reduced and the direct upward pressure on inﬂation from tariﬀs is lower. In the escalation scenario, the Canadian economy contracts through the rest of 2025 and inﬂation rises temporarily above the 2% target due to the direct cost pressures from tariﬀs. 2\n\nResidential investment rises Growth in residential investment strengthens in the second half of 2025, partially due to an increase in resale activity after the steep decline in the ﬁrst half of the year. Growth in residential investment is moderate over 2026 and 2027, supported by dissipating trade uncertainty and rising household incomes. Government spending supports growth Growth in government spending is assumed to remain above that of potential output over the next year, underpinned by higher defence spending by the federal government and increased investment by provincial governments. Inflation Inﬂation stays close to 2% over the scenario horizon (Chart 17). In 2025 and 2026, this reﬂects a series of oﬀsetting pressures.

This boost can be explained by lower tariﬀs, which result in increased US demand for Canadian exports. Export growth then moderates as the positive impact from the new trade agreement fades. Similarly, import growth in Canada rises sharply over roughly the same time frame, fuelled by robust consumer spending and business investment. However, this momentum slows in 2027. Final domestic demand improves Growth in ﬁnal domestic demand rises and remains robust from the second half of 2025 into the ﬁrst quarter of 2026. Growth in both consumption and residential investment is strong, supported by increases in disposable income. Disposable income rises mostly because of the recovery in export demand, which strengthens labour market conditions. After this initial surge, growth in household spending returns to a more moderate pace. Businesses become more conﬁdent in the strength of demand once tariﬀs are lifted, leading to a surge in business investment over roughly the next year. 49"

RBC Economics | thoughtleadership.rbc.com/economics QUARTERLY CANADIAN OUTLOOK | September 15, 2025RBC Economics\n\nThe deterioration in risk sentiment also led to higher credit spreads globally. During this period, markets also priced in additional monetary policy easing by central banks in response to weaker expectations for growth. This led to a decline in short-term government bond yields, both in Canada and globally. Since the April Report, these price movements have essentially all reversed. In response to signs of economic resilience, global equities have recovered and are now trading at or above their levels at the start of 2025. Corporate credit spreads have fully recovered and are in line with their levels at the beginning of 2025. Market volatility is now also more in line with historical averages. Market assessments of growth outlooks have improved. Therefore, markets have priced in less monetary policy easing and the expected policy interest rate paths have returned closer to the levels they were at in early January. This has led to an increase in short-term government bond yields in Canada and many other countries. Since early April, long-term government bond yields have also risen in many countries, including Canada. They are now generally higher than observed in January. In part, this reﬂects higher expected paths for policy rates. As well, some investors have continued to demand a higher term premium for holding long-term government bonds because they are concerned about high public debt and deﬁcits in some countries. Since the beginning of 2025, the US dollar has depreciated steadily against many other currencies. The Nominal Broad US Dollar Index has declined by about 8% from its peak in early January. The value of the Canadian dollar has strengthened against the US dollar to about 73 cents US but has weakened modestly against a basket of other currencies. Continuing depreciation of the US dollar appears to be linked to reduced trade-related uncertainty and improved growth outlooks in economies other than the United States. In addition, there is evidence that some investors are hedging their exposures to the US dollar due to concerns about the future direction of US policy and ﬁscal outlooks. Endnotes 1.

Consumer spending jumped 4.5% in Q2 despite low confidence. Our tracking of RBC card transactions pointed to further Q3 growth. The unemployment rate reached 7.1% in August—the highest outside the pandemic in nearly a decade—but job openings and improving business confidence suggest hiring demand is stabilizing. In our last quarterly update three months ago, we noted key developments in Canada’s outlook were more positive than anticipated when economic sentiment was lowest in spring. This remains true with growth tracking closer to the least negative scenarios from earlier in the year. Resilient growth: Early Q3 GDP indicators look better than Q2. Export volumes rose for a third consecutive month in July and manufacturing sales increased, suggesting Q3 will not be similar to Q2’s large growth subtraction from trade and manufacturing. Housing markets have shown early signs of improvement, and our tracking of RBC card transactions points to growth ahead in consumer spending. CUSMA exemptions: Most Canadian exports to the U.S. remain tariff-free (88% in July) under exemptions for trade compliant with CUSMA. Outside of petroleum exports (which are down sharply from a year ago largely due to lower oil prices), exports of products specifically targeted by tariffs are down 16% from a year ago in July. However, products that have remained largely duty-free are up 0.5%. Fiscal support: Federal and provincial governments have announced significant economic support packages that are increasingly likely to support growth in the year ahead. Limited layoffs: The unemployment rate rise mostly stems from longer job search times for new entrants. Youth unemployment, in particular, has increased sharply. But growth in unemployed workers due to permanent layoffs has slowed to 4.7% year-over-year in August, down from 19% and 24% in 2023 and 2024, respectively.

      "The path of US tariffs remains uncertain Because the trade environment remains so uncertain, the path for Canadian growth and inﬂation is less clear than usual. If the trade conﬂict were to escalate or de- escalate, those shifts would alter economic outcomes. Since January, the United States has threatened, imposed, paused and reinstated tariﬀs on many of its trading partners. It has negotiated agreements with some countries, but many others still face threats of signiﬁcant new tariﬀs. These policy shifts have happened quickly and sometimes without warning. As a result, this Report presents a current tariﬀ scenario instead of a base-case projection as well as two alternative scenarios—a de-escalation scenario and an escalation scenario. When taken together, these scenarios encompass a range of potential outcomes. The current tariﬀ scenario is presented in the Outlook and Global economy sections. This section presents the de-escalation and escalation scenarios. In the de-escalation scenario, tariﬀs are lower than in the current tariﬀ scenario, and the degree of trade uncertainty decreases. Compared with the current tariﬀ scenario: economic growth in Canada rebounds faster once tariﬀs are reduced and uncertainty eases inﬂation in Canada is lower over most of the scenario horizon, primarily because tariﬀs are lifted In the escalation scenario, trade negotiations deteriorate, causing tariﬀs to rise signiﬁcantly. Compared with the current tariﬀ scenario: economic growth in Canada slows markedly, with gross domestic product (GDP) about 1.25% lower by the end of the scenario horizon inﬂation rises faster, because of the increase in tariﬀs, to around 2.5% in 2026, before stabilizing around 2% in 2027 De-escalation scenario In this scenario, the United States lowers its tariﬀs against Canada and other countries. In response, China signiﬁcantly reduces its counter-tariﬀs, while Canada removes them. Although uncertainty declines somewhat, it persists due to lingering concerns about the stability of US trade policy (see the Scenario assumptions section). Economic growth in Canada rebounds over the second half of 2025. It then eases to a more moderate pace over the rest of the scenario horizon. GDP growth is stronger than in the current tariﬀ scenario because the removal of tariﬀs and reduced uncertainty lead to stronger growth in exports and domestic demand. The level of GDP is roughly 0.5% higher at the end of the scenario horizon. Consumer price index (CPI) inﬂation stays below the 2% target until late 2026. It then averages around 2% in 2027. Inﬂation in 2026 is lower than in the current tariﬀ scenario because tariﬀs are lifted. 47\n\nb.

After that, export growth resumes as Canadian exporters adjust to the new trade environment. Imports decline until the ﬁrst quarter of 2026 as counter-tariﬀs and weak business investment reduce demand for inputs from abroad. Import growth then picks up, supported by growth in domestic demand. Domestic demand moderates due to trade pressures The intensifying global conﬂict slows growth in ﬁnal domestic demand in Canada. Household purchasing power weakens because of deteriorating labour market conditions. Less demand from the United States causes some exporters to reduce hours and lay oﬀ workers. Additionally, a decline in Canada’s terms of trade weighs on household incomes, and higher tariﬀs raise the prices of imports, such as food and consumer goods. Business investment falls because of higher import costs and reduced demand for capital goods due to lower exports. However, as the trade environment begins to stabilize, investment growth turns positive. 52\n\nThe trade war took a larger than expected bite out of Canadian gross domestic product in Q2, but data still shows an economy that has weathered recent trade pressures better than feared when uncertainty was most acute in the spring. Trade-sensitive sectors have faced significant challenges. Exports declined sharply in Q2 and manufacturing contracted by an annualized 8%. U.S. imports of steel and aluminum products from Canada targeted with 50% tariffs decreased almost 50% year-over-year in July. But critically, most Canadian exports continue to cross the border duty-free thanks to CUSMA exemptions, and weakness remains largely contained to directly impacted sectors. Employment in manufacturing and transportation sectors are down 32,000 from the end of 2024, but up 70,000 in other industries. Canadian outlook Quarterly Canadian outlook Low but positive growth aheadRBC Economics September 15, 2025 RBC Economics | thoughtleadership.rbc.com/economics\n\nCurrent tariff scenario The current tariﬀ scenario assumes the following tariﬀs are in place. US tariﬀ measures on Canada: a 50% tariﬀ on imports of steel and aluminum a 25% tariﬀ on the non-US content of imported motor vehicles a 25% tariﬀ on motor vehicle parts that do not comply with the Canada-United States- Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) a 25% tariﬀ on imported goods that do not comply with CUSMA (a 10% tariﬀ on energy or potash products), other than on motor vehicles and parts CUSMA-compliance is assumed to be: 100% for energy exports 95% for all other goods exports1 Canada’s retaliatory tariﬀs on the United States: a 25% tariﬀ on approximately $60 billion of imports of US goods a 25% tariﬀ on the US content of vehicles imported from the United States with exceptions for CUSMA-compliant components made in Canada and Mexico United States measures on countries other than Canada: a tariﬀ of at least 50% on imports of steel, aluminum and certain related household appliances a tariﬀ of at least 25% on the non-US content of imported motor vehicles and parts, with lower tariﬀ rates for the European Union, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom, as established in their trade agreements an increase in tariﬀs of 28 percentage points on goods from China compared with the start of 2025, representing both bilateral and sectoral tariﬀs an increase in tariﬀs of 9 percentage points on average on countries outside of Canada and China compared with the start of 2025 China’s retaliatory tariﬀs on the United States: an increase in tariﬀs on US goods equivalent to 13 percentage points China’s retaliatory tariﬀs on Canada: 100% on some agricultural products and 25% on pork and seafood products Other countries: no retaliatory tariﬀs imposed Other key assumptions include: Trade policy uncertainty remains elevated around the world into 2026 Trade tensions reduce total factor productivity (TFP) and investment, lowering the level of Canadian potential output by 0.5% in 2027 Global potential output is lower by 0.1% in 2027 Over the scenario horizon, the per-barrel prices for oil are assumed to be US$65 for Brent, US$60 for West Texas Intermediate and US$50 for Western Canadian Select The Canadian dollar is assumed to average 73 cents US over the scenario 22\n\nCentral bank flexibility: Additional interest rate cuts from the Bank of Canada aren’t in our base case forecasts, but policymakers can reduce rates if needed. Net trade likely won’t repeat its Q2 decline, household spending has continued to surprise on the upside, and fiscal support (better suited to address sector-specific tariff headwinds) is increasing. However, weak Q2 GDP and recent labour market reports makes a September rate cut essentially a toss-up. Some downside risks remain U.S. dependency risks: Canada maintains relatively favorable U.S. tariff rates, but that provides little comfort if broader U.S. tariff hikes cause the tightly integrated North American industrial sector to shrink. The U.S. unemployment rate remains historically low, but job growth has stalled since April with weakness concentrated in industrial sectors where Canadian economic ties are strongest. Maintaining CUSMA exemption is critical on both sides of the border: The CUSMA exemption continues to protect most Canadian exports from U.S. tariffs, and maintaining it is vital for Canadian exporters. But, as we argued here, the agreement is also important for U.S. importers, who would see already escalating import costs accelerate significantly without it. CUSMA doesn’t (automatically) expire until 2036, and negotiations to extend the agreement (negotiated by the first Trump administration) beyond that time start next year at the latest. U.S. trade policy remains highly unpredictable, but the continuation of CUSMA protections through multiple rounds of U.S. tariffs is an implicit recognition of its mutual benefits.

    "answer": "Tariffs and trade tensions are expected to affect Canada's economy in the following ways:\n\n1. **Economic Growth**: In the escalation scenario, economic growth in Canada slows markedly, with GDP about 1.25% lower by the end of the scenario horizon. In the de-escalation scenario, economic growth rebounds faster once tariffs are reduced, leading to stronger growth in exports and domestic demand, with GDP roughly 0.5% higher at the end of the scenario horizon.\n\n2. **Inflation**: In the escalation scenario, inflation rises faster due to increased tariffs, reaching around 2.5% in 2026 before stabilizing around 2% in 2027. In the de-escalation scenario, inflation stays below the 2% target until late 2026 and then averages around 2% in 2027, primarily because tariffs are lifted.\n\n3. **Exports and Imports**: In the escalation scenario, export growth contracts due to higher US tariffs on Canadian imports and a global economic slowdown. Imports decline until the first quarter of 2026 due to counter-tariffs and weak business investment. In the de-escalation scenario, export growth resumes as Canadian exporters adjust to the new trade environment, and import growth picks up supported by growth in domestic demand.\n\n4. **Domestic Demand**: Domestic demand moderates due to trade pressures in the escalation scenario, with weakened household purchasing power and reduced demand for capital goods. In the de-escalation scenario, stronger growth in domestic demand is expected as uncertainty eases.\n\n5. **Employment**: Employment in manufacturing and transportation sectors is down, but there is an increase in other industries. The overall impact on employment is mixed, with some sectors facing challenges while others see growth.\n\n6. **Investment**: Business investment falls in the escalation scenario due to higher import costs and reduced demand for capital goods, but turns positive as the trade environment stabilizes. \n\nOverall, the trade environment and tariff policies significantly influence Canada's economic growth, inflation, exports, imports, domestic demand, employment, and investment.",

Canadian outlook Quarterly Canadian outlook Low but positive growth aheadRBC Economics September 15, 2025 RBC Economics | thoughtleadership.rbc.com/economics\n\nProvincial overview Provincial growth diverges amid trade tensions While Canada faces a national shock from its trade relationship with the United States, the provinces are facing differentiated trade shocks that are creating divergences in both growth and growth drivers. First, the doubling of U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%, and newly added tariffs on copper of 50% has prompted further downgrades of our 2025 growth forecasts for: Ontario, Quebec and Manitoba. Second, heightened duties on lumber exports—which are compounding existing challenges of investment weakness—implies a lower growth projection for British Columbia as well. Third, while all eyes are on U.S. tariffs, Chinese tariffs are also in play. Seafood tariffs had already been incorporated into earlier projections, and therefore haven’t altered the better-than-national average growth outlook for Atlantic provinces. Chinese canola tariffs in effect from August were implemented too late in the 2025 growing season to impact our gross domestic product outlook for the Prairies this year. We will, however, monitor trade negotiations closely as they unfold over the next six months, and may adjust our 2026 forecasts depending on outcomes. RBC Economics | thoughtleadership.rbc.com/economics QUARTERLY CANADIAN OUTLOOK | September 15, 2025RBC Economics\n\nQuebec and Ontario hardest hit by trade turbulence Off the back of trade wars, we are reducing our 2025 growth forecast for Ontario and Quebec from 1.3% to 0.9% for Ontario, and from 1.3% to 1.2% for Quebec. Importantly, the impacts thus far of U.S. tariffs have fallen more heavily on Ontario than Quebec, reflecting fundamental differences in market conditions for primary metals. Quebec’s aluminum production maintains relative competitiveness due to lower production costs and shrinking capacity for U.S. aluminum production. This pattern mirrors previous episodes of tariffs on Canadian primary metals, when Quebec’s aluminum sector proved more resilient. We’ve also seen early signs of export diversification away from the U.S. with European markets consuming an increasing share of Quebec’s metal exports. Still, the economic spillover from these manufacturing challenges is extending to neighboring provinces, keeping Manitoba and New Brunswick underperforming their regional peers. U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum derivatives are creating significant headwinds for Manitoba’s manufacturing sector—particularly in transportation equipment such as aerospace and machinery—which rely heavily on embedded metal content. We have downgraded our 2025 real GDP forecast for Manitoba to 1% from 1.2%. Looking ahead, the mid-August expansion of Chinese tariffs could create challenges for exporters in the Prairies. China is the largest export destination for canola seed from Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Manitoba. Meanwhile, Prince Edward Island, for example continues to demonstrate remarkable resilience with robust tourism, and sustained construction investment supporting an upward revision of our 2025 growth forecast to 2% from 1.7%. RBC Economics | thoughtleadership.rbc.com/economics QUARTERLY CANADIAN OUTLOOK | September 15, 2025RBC Economics\n\nOutlook for rest of the year is brighter Positive Factors Meanwhile, activity outside of tariff-affected sectors has been resilient. Consumer spending jumped 4.5% in Q2 despite low confidence. Our tracking of RBC card transactions pointed to further Q3 growth. The unemployment rate reached 7.1% in August—the highest outside the pandemic in nearly a decade—but job openings and improving business confidence suggest hiring demand is stabilizing. In our last quarterly update three months ago, we noted key developments in Canada’s outlook were more positive than anticipated when economic sentiment was lowest in spring. This remains true with growth tracking closer to the least negative scenarios from earlier in the year. Resilient growth: Early Q3 GDP indicators look better than Q2. Export volumes rose for a third consecutive month in July and manufacturing sales increased, suggesting Q3 will not be similar to Q2’s large growth subtraction from trade and manufacturing. Housing markets have shown early signs of improvement, and our tracking of RBC card transactions points to growth ahead in consumer spending. CUSMA exemptions: Most Canadian exports to the U.S. remain tariff-free (88% in July) under exemptions for trade compliant with CUSMA. Outside of petroleum exports (which are down sharply from a year ago largely due to lower oil prices), exports of products specifically targeted by tariffs are down 16% from a year ago in July. However, products that have remained largely duty-free are up 0.5%. Fiscal support: Federal and provincial governments have announced significant economic support packages that are increasingly likely to support growth in the year ahead. Limited layoffs: The unemployment rate rise mostly stems from longer job search times for new entrants. Youth unemployment, in particular, has increased sharply. But growth in unemployed workers due to permanent layoffs has slowed to 4.7% year-over-year in August, down from 19% and 24% in 2023 and 2024, respectively.

This boost can be explained by lower tariﬀs, which result in increased US demand for Canadian exports. Export growth then moderates as the positive impact from the new trade agreement fades. Similarly, import growth in Canada rises sharply over roughly the same time frame, fuelled by robust consumer spending and business investment. However, this momentum slows in 2027. Final domestic demand improves Growth in ﬁnal domestic demand rises and remains robust from the second half of 2025 into the ﬁrst quarter of 2026. Growth in both consumption and residential investment is strong, supported by increases in disposable income. Disposable income rises mostly because of the recovery in export demand, which strengthens labour market conditions.

Import growth then picks up, supported by growth in domestic demand. Domestic demand moderates due to trade pressures The intensifying global conﬂict slows growth in ﬁnal domestic demand in Canada. Household purchasing power weakens because of deteriorating labour market conditions. Less demand from the United States causes some exporters to reduce hours and lay oﬀ workers. Additionally, a decline in Canada’s terms of trade weighs on household incomes, and higher tariﬀs raise the prices of imports, such as food and consumer goods. Business investment falls because of higher import costs and reduced demand for capital goods due to lower exports. However, as the trade environment begins to stabilize, investment growth turns positive. 52\n\nCurrent conditions Canadian economic activity has slowed considerably because of the trade conﬂict but is showing signs of resilience. While inﬂation is close to 2%, underlying inﬂation has risen to about 2½%. The trade conﬂict disrupted the Canadian economy in the ﬁrst half of 2025. In the ﬁrst quarter, trade was pulled forward in anticipation of tariﬀs, and exports grew rapidly. As a result, Canada’s gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 2.2%. At the same time, growth in ﬁnal domestic demand stalled as uncertainty about the trade environment began to weigh on business and household spending. The impact of tariﬀs on economic activity continued to play out in the second quarter; GDP is estimated to have fallen by 1.5%. Exports fell because trade activity brought forward in the two previous quarters was reversed and tariﬀs were imposed. Heightened uncertainty weighed on spending by businesses and households. Job losses were concentrated in sectors that rely on trade. Employment in the rest of the economy continued to grow modestly. Consumer price index (CPI) inﬂation was 1.9% in June. CPI inﬂation excluding indirect taxes rose from about 2% in the second half of 2024 to 2.5% in June. This is largely due to higher inﬂation in prices for non-energy goods. Price increases in shelter services are holding inﬂation up but have continued to ease as expected. Tariﬀs have had only a limited eﬀect on inﬂation to date. Household inﬂation expectations remain elevated, while businesses’ inﬂation expectations have moderated. Some businesses, however, report that the shifts in global trade are imposing new costs on their operations. Economic activity GDP growth for the ﬁrst quarter of 2025 was stronger than expected at 2.2%. Trade activity was brought forward ahead of anticipated tariﬀs, boosting growth. Exports surged, and the drag from higher imports was oﬀset by a strong pick-up in inventories. In contrast, ﬁnal domestic demand was ﬂat in the ﬁrst quarter. Residential investment fell, led by a steep decline in housing resale activity. Government spending was pulled down by shipments of military aid to Ukraine. 1 Growth in consumption and business investment slowed because of heightened uncertainty about US trade policy, along with a pullback after strong growth in the fourth quarter of 2024. In the second quarter of 2025, GDP is estimated to have contracted by 1.5%, primarily due to a sharp drop in exports after tariﬀs were imposed ( Chart 1). The eﬀects of tariﬀs and trade uncertainty also continued to weigh on household spending and business investment. A rebound in government spending after weakness in the ﬁrst quarter provided a partial oﬀset. 3\n\nOutlook for rest of the year is brighter Positive Factors Meanwhile, activity outside of tariff-affected sectors has been resilient.

The decline in goods imports reﬂects both a broad reversal from the ﬁrst quarter and the impact of Canadian countermeasures to US tariﬀs. A drop in the number of Canadians travelling to the United States also weighed on services imports. Inventories are estimated to have expanded further, adding to GDP growth. Growth in ﬁnal domestic demand is muted Final domestic demand was ﬂat in the ﬁrst quarter of 2025. Consumer spending and business investment continued to grow but at a slower pace than in the fourth quarter of 2024. This modest growth was oﬀset by an 11% fall in residential investment and a decline in government expenditures. In the second quarter of 2025, growth in ﬁnal domestic demand is estimated to be just above 1%, supported by resilience in growth in consumption, along with increased government spending. Declines in business and residential investment partially oﬀset this increase. Consumption growth is estimated to be about 1%, reﬂecting a soft labour market and slowing population growth. While results from the Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations (CSCE) for the second quarter of 2025 suggest consumer sentiment declined, some other surveys indicate an improvement more recently. Government spending is estimated to have picked up by about 3.5% after the temporary decline in the ﬁrst quarter. 5\n\nOutlook for rest of the year is brighter Positive Factors Meanwhile, activity outside of tariff-affected sectors has been resilient. Consumer spending jumped 4.5% in Q2 despite low confidence. Our tracking of RBC card transactions pointed to further Q3 growth. The unemployment rate reached 7.1% in August—the highest outside the pandemic in nearly a decade—but job openings and improving business confidence suggest hiring demand is stabilizing. In our last quarterly update three months ago, we noted key developments in Canada’s outlook were more positive than anticipated when economic sentiment was lowest in spring. This remains true with growth tracking closer to the least negative scenarios from earlier in the year. Resilient growth: Early Q3 GDP indicators look better than Q2. Export volumes rose for a third consecutive month in July and manufacturing sales increased, suggesting Q3 will not be similar to Q2’s large growth subtraction from trade and manufacturing. Housing markets have shown early signs of improvement, and our tracking of RBC card transactions points to growth ahead in consumer spending. CUSMA exemptions: Most Canadian exports to the U.S. remain tariff-free (88% in July) under exemptions for trade compliant with CUSMA. Outside of petroleum exports (which are down sharply from a year ago largely due to lower oil prices), exports of products specifically targeted by tariffs are down 16% from a year ago in July. However, products that have remained largely duty-free are up 0.5%. Fiscal support: Federal and provincial governments have announced significant economic support packages that are increasingly likely to support growth in the year ahead. Limited layoffs: The unemployment rate rise mostly stems from longer job search times for new entrants. Youth unemployment, in particular, has increased sharply. But growth in unemployed workers due to permanent layoffs has slowed to 4.7% year-over-year in August, down from 19% and 24% in 2023 and 2024, respectively.

This boost can be explained by lower tariﬀs, which result in increased US demand for Canadian exports. Export growth then moderates as the positive impact from the new trade agreement fades. Similarly, import growth in Canada rises sharply over roughly the same time frame, fuelled by robust consumer spending and business investment. However, this momentum slows in 2027. Final domestic demand improves Growth in ﬁnal domestic demand rises and remains robust from the second half of 2025 into the ﬁrst quarter of 2026. Growth in both consumption and residential investment is strong, supported by increases in disposable income. Disposable income rises mostly because of the recovery in export demand, which strengthens labour market conditions. After this initial surge, growth in household spending returns to a more moderate pace. Businesses become more conﬁdent in the strength of demand once tariﬀs are lifted, leading to a surge in business investment over roughly the next year. 49\n\nChart 16: Non-commodity exports remain below their 2024 levels Annualized, quarterly data, chained 2017 Canadian dollars Can$ billions 400 410 420 430 440 450 460 Start of scenario horizon (2025Q2) 2024 2025 2026 2027 Current tariff scenario January Report Sources: Statistics Canada and Bank of Canada calculations and estimates Last data plotted: 2027Q4 Growth of commodity exports is supported by new export capacity for liqueﬁed natural gas and the increased use of the Trans Mountain pipeline. Imports decline in the second half of 2025 partly because of the impact of Canadian countermeasures. Import growth then picks up in 2026 and 2027 as overall economic activity improves. Business investment is soft over the near term Business investment contracts in the second half of 2025, still weighed down by elevated uncertainty. Growth in business investment picks up in 2026 and 2027. This growth is supported by diminishing uncertainty and a stronger Canadian dollar, which lowers the cost of imported machinery and equipment. Growth in consumption picks up in 2027 Consumption growth remains modest in the second half of 2025 and in 2026. It is constrained by ongoing trade policy uncertainty, which holds back labour income growth. Higher mortgage payments for some households facing renewals further weigh on consumption. Tax cuts and government transfers provide a partial oﬀset. 1 Growth in consumption spending picks up in 2027 because of the diminishing impact of trade uncertainty and stronger growth in labour income. 29\n\nA summary of economic conditions Consumer price index (CPI) inﬂation was 1.9% in June. Changes in indirect taxes, such as the HST/GST holiday and the removal of the consumer carbon tax, have impacted CPI inﬂation since late 2024. When indirect taxes are excluded, inﬂation rose to 2.5% in June 2025 from around 2% in the second half of 2024. This increase was mainly because inﬂation in non-energy goods prices rose, more than oﬀsetting an easing in inﬂation in shelter services prices. Similarly, most measures of core inﬂation have picked up since late 2024. Overall, underlying inﬂation is now assessed to be around 2½%. Growth in the Canadian economy in the ﬁrst quarter of 2025 was stronger than expected at 2.2%, largely due to a temporary surge in exports in anticipation of US tariﬀs. Growth is estimated to have contracted in the second quarter. While exports and business investment have fallen, growth in consumer spending has been resilient, and spending by government has picked up. In the current tariﬀ scenario, Canada’s economic growth is modest at 1% in the second half of 2025. Growth then rises, reaching 1.8% in 2027 as the eﬀects of trade policy uncertainty fade and as global demand and exports increase modestly. Inﬂation remains close to 2% throughout the scenario horizon. The upside pressures and the downside pressures on inﬂation are roughly oﬀsetting and dissipate over time. In the de-escalation scenario, growth is stronger, excess supply is reduced and the direct upward pressure on inﬂation from tariﬀs is lower. In the escalation scenario, the Canadian economy contracts through the rest of 2025 and inﬂation rises temporarily above the 2% target due to the direct cost pressures from tariﬀs. 2"

      "Main downside risks to inflation Tariﬀs could weaken the economy more than expected The demand for Canadian exports may be weaker than in the current tariﬀ scenario. This could arise because: global economic activity is weaker US tariﬀs on Canadian goods have a bigger impact than expected In addition, the weakness in the export sector could spread to the rest of the Canadian economy by more than expected. With unemployment already at elevated levels and households uncertain about their economic future, spending on housing and other major purchases could be meaningfully softer. This impact could be ampliﬁed by the recent weakness in some regional housing markets. Greater excess supply in the Canadian economy would create more downward pressure on inﬂation. Global ﬁnancial conditions could be tighter Long-term government bond yields could increase in response to the rapid expansion of government debt issuance around the world. This could, in turn, lead to higher borrowing costs for Canadian households and businesses. The result would be weaker domestic demand and greater downward pressure on Canadian inﬂation because of excess supply. 46\n\nRisks Considerable uncertainty surrounds the outlook for inﬂation. It is extremely diﬃcult to predict how US trade policy will play out and how businesses, households and governments will react to a given level of tariﬀs. The outlook also faces risks that are not directly related to tariﬀs. There are three main types of risks to the outlook for inﬂation. The ﬁrst is the level of tariﬀs. To address this risk, this Report presents a current tariﬀ scenario and two alternative scenarios—a de- escalation scenario and an escalation scenario. When taken together, these scenarios encompass a range of potential outcomes (see the Outlook and Global economy sections and In focus: The path of US tari ﬀs remains uncertain). The second type is the eﬀect that tariﬀs will have on the economy. Regardless of how US trade policy evolves, risks remain with respect to how businesses, households and governments will react and adapt. Tariﬀs, counter-tariﬀs and the reconﬁguration of trade could lead to more persistent cost pressures than captured in the scenarios. This is of particular concern given the recent uptick in underlying inﬂation. The third type encompasses risks beyond those related to the trade conﬂict. This section addresses the second and third types of risks. Main upside risks to inflation Trade conﬂict could put greater upward pressure on inﬂation Tariﬀs could put greater upward pressure on inﬂation than in the current tariﬀ scenario: Businesses may pass on a larger share of the cost of tariﬀs to consumers. This pass-through may also happen at a faster pace. Global supply chains could be more severely aﬀected, and the costs of reconﬁguring trade could be higher than assessed, raising production costs and import prices. Businesses not directly impacted by tariﬀs may take advantage of the reduced competition and raise their prices. Inﬂation expectations could drift higher, especially given the recent experience of high inﬂation. Consumers and businesses aﬀected by tariﬀ-related price increases may begin to expect that prices will rise persistently at an elevated pace. This expectation could feed through to wage demands and costs and could inﬂuence how businesses set their prices. These risks would likely be ampliﬁed in the escalation scenario. Geopolitical tensions could increase costs Ongoing geopolitical tensions could lead to unexpected upward pressure on costs. For example, oil prices could rise sharply if tensions in the Middle East increased or Russia’s war on Ukraine escalated again. This would drive up fuel prices and cause inﬂation to rise. If these conﬂicts were to escalate, global supply chains could also be disrupted. 45\n\nFactors leading to higher inﬂation include: the end of the downward impact from the elimination of the consumer carbon tax in the second quarter of 2026 Canada’s counter-tariﬀs, which add up to 0.6 percentage points to inﬂation, particularly aﬀecting the prices of goods such as food and motor vehicles In addition, businesses report that they are facing new costs due to the reconﬁguration of trade, including the cost of ﬁnding new markets and restructuring their supply chains. These cost pressures are particularly diﬃcult to assess, and there is a risk that they will be more signiﬁcant than anticipated. Factors leading to lower inﬂation include: excess supply and slower growth in unit labour costs easing inﬂation in shelter prices, reﬂecting slower growth in rent prices and mortgage interest costs the recent appreciation of the Canadian dollar In 2027, inﬂation remains close to 2% as the eﬀects of tariﬀs dissipate and excess supply begins to shrink. The composition of inﬂation shifts, with inﬂation in goods prices easing and inﬂation in services prices stabilizing near historical norms. Comparison of recent Bank outlooks Chart 18 compares the current tariﬀ scenario with the January Report and previous Reports. In January, the near-term outlook for inﬂation was higher than in the current tariﬀ scenario because the consumer carbon tax was still in place. The April Report is excluded because it presented a range of scenarios. Chart 18: The July 2025 and January 2025 Monetary Policy Report outlooks CPI inflation (year-over-year percentage change) 4 3 2 1 0 2024 2025 2026 2027 July 2025 current tariff scenario January 2025 projection The outlook for GDP growth in the current tariﬀ scenario is signiﬁcantly weaker than it was at the time of the January Report, before the trade conﬂict intensiﬁed (Table 2 and Table 3). GDP growth is approximately 0.5 percentage points lower in both 2025 and 2026 due to the negative eﬀect of tariﬀs and associated uncertainty. Potential output is weaker by the end of 2026 because tariﬀs and uncertainty lead to lower trend labour productivity. 31\n\nfor both 2025 and 2026. 17. Aggregate consumer price inflation for the G20 countries is expected to decline as economic growth and labour markets ease (Figure 8, Panel B). In the United States, the increase in effective tariff rates will further boost inflation, with the rate of pass-through to final goods prices assumed to strengthen as businesses become less w illing to absorb the rising cost of imported goods. As a result, US annual inflation is projected to remain above target throughout 2026. In the euro area, inflation is anticipated to remain subdued, while the normalisation of food prices in Japan will contribute to inflation moving back to the central bank target in 2026. Overall, headline inflation in the G20 advanced economies is projected to be 2.5% in both 2025 and 2026, while core inflation is also anticipated to remain broadly stable at 2.6% in 2025 and 2.5% in 2026. In the G20 emerging-market economies, inflation is projected to decline more noticeably, with headline inflation of 4.1% in 2025 and 3. 1% in 2026. Significant further disinflation in Argentina and Türkiye are key factors, but inflation is also anticipated to moderate in Brazil and Mexico. In contrast, a rise in inflation is projected for Indonesia, as past exchange rate depreciation feeds into domestic prices. In China, inflation is expected to gradually increase from its current very low level, partly reflecting the imposition of higher tariff rates on goods imported from the United States.\n\nChart 23: US inflation picked up in June US consumer price index, year-over-year percentage change, monthly data 2.2% 2.4% 2.6% 2.8% 3.0% 3.2% 3.4% Jul 2024 Sep 2024 Nov 2024 Jan 2025 Mar 2025 May 2025 Total Excluding food and energy Source: US Bureau of Labor Statistics via Haver Analytics Last observation: June 2025 Wage growth has been solid and, given robust labour productivity growth, remains consistent with the Federal Reserve’s 2% inﬂation target. Interest rates are restraining demand and putting downward pressure on inﬂation. Tariﬀs continue to weigh on US growth In the scenario, tariﬀs and uncertainty weigh on US economic activity. The increase in tariﬀs permanently reduces the path for the level of GDP. GDP growth picks up modestly to about 2¼% on average in 2026 and 2027. Growth in consumption spending slows meaningfully in 2026 because tariﬀ-driven inﬂation erodes income gains and policy uncertainty weighs on consumer conﬁdence. Expansionary ﬁscal policy and an easing in monetary policy provide partial oﬀsets. Consumption recovers in 2027, supported by real wage growth and the diminishing eﬀects of uncertainty. Business investment growth is restrained by tariﬀs and ongoing uncertainty. The rollout of AI- related spending provides a boost in the near term. Export growth picks up modestly in 2026 and 2027 due to improving global demand and the depreciation of the US dollar. Imports fall sharply in response to tariﬀs before recovering in 2027. US inﬂation picks up and peaks close to 3% at the end of 2025 as the impact of tariﬀs takes hold and the eﬀect from past declines in the price of oil fades. It then moderates as the impact from tariﬀs dissipates. 39"

In CBO’s projections, inflation as measured by the PCE price index (the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure) falls from 2.5 percent in 2024 to 2.2 percent in 2025, reflecting moderating demand for labor and slower growth in housing costs.

Five-year Inflation Expectations\n\n18  FINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE IN UNCERTAIN TIMES © OECD 2025 Policy requirements Trade policies need to become more transparent and predictable 23. Countries need to find ways of engaging co -operatively within the global trading system and working together to make trade policy more predictable. Agreements to ease trade tensions and lower existing trade barriers, a nd clear and transparent trade policies , would improve policy certainty and strengthen the prospects for investment and growth. Steps to lower tariffs and non-tariff barriers, deepen trade agreements or reduce barriers to trade in services would also benefit productivity and living standards. Efforts to prevent further trade fragmentation should be coupled with reforms that enhance security and strengthen the resilience of supply chains, including by encouraging firms to diversify both suppliers and buyers and by agreements between countries that align regulatory standards on key intermediate production inputs. This would help to balance economic security needs with continued growth while preserving open markets. Monetary policy should remain vigilant 24. Policy interest rates have been lowered recently by many major central banks. Amongst the advanced economies, both the United States and Canada reduced policy rates in September , with concerns about downside risks in labour markets outweighing the risk of upside inflationary pressures from tariff increases. In contrast, policy rates have remained unchanged in Japan since January, and in the euro area since June given area-wide inflation close to target and policy rates close to neutral. Policy rates have been reduced in many major emerging market economies given contained inflation pressures, recent currency appreciation against the US dollar, and adverse demand shocks from higher US trade costs and elevated uncertainty. Brazil is an exception, with the policy rate having been raised further to ensure that inflation expectations remain well -anchored. Central bank balance sheet reductions have also continued in many countries , but the pace has moderated in some, including the United States and the United Kingdom. 25. Central banks need to remain vigilant and attentive to shifts in the balance of risks around economic developments and financial markets in order to maintain price stability. Provided inflation expectations remain well anchored, pol icy rate reductions should continue in economies in which underlying inflation is projected to moderate towards target (Figure 10). The ability and incentives of policymakers to react quickly and credibly to shifts in the risks to price stability are enhanced by central bank independence, both legal and operational, and accountability. These lower the volatility and persistence of inflation by helping to ensure that long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. 26. In the United States, polic y rates are projected to decline further over the coming year as labour market pressures ease, provided the ongoing rise in the relative price of tradeable goods from higher tariffs does not trigger broader inflation pressures. A gradual easing of policy rates is also expected in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. In the euro area, where policy rates are already close to neutral levels, the policy stance is expected to remain unchanged. Policy rates are projected to increase in Japan as monetary poli cy accommodation continues to be gradually withdrawn . Amongst the emerging -market economies, policy rates are expected to decline in Brazil, Mexico and Türkiye, as inflation pressures moderate, but remain broadly unchanged in most other economies. In China, the policy stance is expected to remain accommodative given the underlying softness of inflation.\n\n 13 FINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE IN UNCERTAIN TIMES © OECD 2025 shown limited signs of disinflation, with price pressures remaining elevated compared with the pre-pandemic period.

Inflation then declines more gradually, reaching 2.1 percent in 2026. From 2027 to 2035, it averages 2.0 percent per year. Outlook for Inflation and Interest Rates Inflation slows in 2025 and settles at 2% or less after 2026. After 2025, short-term interest rates remain below 10-year rates, reflecting their typical relationship.

Interest rates are restraining demand and putting downward pressure on inﬂation. Tariﬀs continue to weigh on US growth In the scenario, tariﬀs and uncertainty weigh on US economic activity. The increase in tariﬀs permanently reduces the path for the level of GDP. GDP growth picks up modestly to about 2¼% on average in 2026 and 2027. Growth in consumption spending slows meaningfully in 2026 because tariﬀ-driven inﬂation erodes income gains and policy uncertainty weighs on consumer conﬁdence. Expansionary ﬁscal policy and an easing in monetary policy provide partial oﬀsets. Consumption recovers in 2027, supported by real wage growth and the diminishing eﬀects of uncertainty. Business investment growth is restrained by tariﬀs and ongoing uncertainty. The rollout of AI- related spending provides a boost in the near term. Export growth picks up modestly in 2026 and 2027 due to improving global demand and the depreciation of the US dollar. Imports fall sharply in response to tariﬀs before recovering in 2027. US inﬂation picks up and peaks close to 3% at the end of 2025 as the impact of tariﬀs takes hold and the eﬀect from past declines in the price of oil fades. It then moderates as the impact from tariﬀs dissipates. 39\n\nFour Years in Review and the Years Ahead | 83 The forecast jumps off from a 4.1 percent unemployment rate in October 2024, which is slightly higher than the Administration’s estimate of the 3.8 percent rate consistent with stable inflation. As a result, with real output forecasted to grow 2.1 percent during the four quarters of 2025, slightly faster than the potential GDP growth rate, the unemployment rate edges down to 3.8 percent by the end of the year without an increase in inflation. In comparison, the Blue Chip consensus panel expects a slightly lower real GDP growth rate of 1.9 percent. Many other forces will be at work during 2025. In this particular forecast, a glide path of fiscal consoli- dation is assumed and the legacy of tight monetary policy still restrains the growth rate of investment and consumer spending. After the unemployment rate falls by the end of 2025 to 3.8 percent, the rate consistent with stable inflation, it is expected to remain there for the rest of the forecast interval, consistent with GDP growing at its potential growth rate. After falling dramatically from 7.1 percent in 2022 to 3.2 percent in 2023 (Q4 to Q4 changes), CPI inflation appears on track to fall further to 2.6 percent during the four quarters of 2024. The Administration expects CPI inflation to fall slightly further during 2025 to 2.3 percent, a rate that is consistent with the Federal Reserve’s 2.0 percent target for the PCE Price Index. CPI inflation tends to run higher than PCE inflation; over the 45 years through 2023, CPI inflation exceeded PCE inflation by 0.3 percentage point.25 The price index for GDP—a measure of inflation for everything produced in the United States—is expected to fall from a forecasted 2.4 percent during 2024 to 2.2 percent during 2025. In response to an increase in inflation, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate in 2022 and 2023, then let it plateau at roughly 5.3 percent for more than a year. Following evidence of a decline in inflation, the FOMC took the first step down from that plateau in September 2024 and another step in November. The three-month Treasury bill (T-bill) rate also fell around the same time. Looking ahead, as inflation settles near the FOMC’s target, further declines in T-bill rates are expected by private professional forecasters, the FOMC, and the Administration, with the caveat that the FOMC’s future rate cuts will be data dependent. After adjusting for 2 per- cent expected PCE inflation, the real rate on three-month T-bills is expected to be about 0.9 percent. With respect to the long end of interest rate forecasts, the Administration expects the yield on 10-year Treasury notes to edge down slightly from an expected 4.2 percent average during 2024 to 3.8 percent by 2028 and then remain there for the rest of the 11-year forecast interval. In principle, the cur- rent 10-year yield should be the expected average yield on the three-month T-bill during the next 10 years, plus a term premium. From this perspective, 25 This calculation uses the retroactive series from the BLS: R-CPI-U-RS."

    "retrieved_contexts": [
      "Central bank flexibility: Additional interest rate cuts from the Bank of Canada aren’t in our base case forecasts, but policymakers can reduce rates if needed. Net trade likely won’t repeat its Q2 decline, household spending has continued to surprise on the upside, and fiscal support (better suited to address sector-specific tariff headwinds) is increasing. However, weak Q2 GDP and recent labour market reports makes a September rate cut essentially a toss-up. Some downside risks remain U.S. dependency risks: Canada maintains relatively favorable U.S. tariff rates, but that provides little comfort if broader U.S. tariff hikes cause the tightly integrated North American industrial sector to shrink. The U.S. unemployment rate remains historically low, but job growth has stalled since April with weakness concentrated in industrial sectors where Canadian economic ties are strongest. Maintaining CUSMA exemption is critical on both sides of the border: The CUSMA exemption continues to protect most Canadian exports from U.S. tariffs, and maintaining it is vital for Canadian exporters. But, as we argued here, the agreement is also important for U.S. importers, who would see already escalating import costs accelerate significantly without it. CUSMA doesn’t (automatically) expire until 2036, and negotiations to extend the agreement (negotiated by the first Trump administration) beyond that time start next year at the latest. U.S. trade policy remains highly unpredictable, but the continuation of CUSMA protections through multiple rounds of U.S. tariffs is an implicit recognition of its mutual benefits. RBC Economics | thoughtleadership.rbc.com/economics QUARTERLY CANADIAN OUTLOOK | September 15, 2025RBC Economics\n\nOutlook for rest of the year is brighter Positive Factors Meanwhile, activity outside of tariff-affected sectors has been resilient. Consumer spending jumped 4.5% in Q2 despite low confidence. Our tracking of RBC card transactions pointed to further Q3 growth. The unemployment rate reached 7.1% in August—the highest outside the pandemic in nearly a decade—but job openings and improving business confidence suggest hiring demand is stabilizing. In our last quarterly update three months ago, we noted key developments in Canada’s outlook were more positive than anticipated when economic sentiment was lowest in spring. This remains true with growth tracking closer to the least negative scenarios from earlier in the year. Resilient growth: Early Q3 GDP indicators look better than Q2. Export volumes rose for a third consecutive month in July and manufacturing sales increased, suggesting Q3 will not be similar to Q2’s large growth subtraction from trade and manufacturing. Housing markets have shown early signs of improvement, and our tracking of RBC card transactions points to growth ahead in consumer spending. CUSMA exemptions: Most Canadian exports to the U.S. remain tariff-free (88% in July) under exemptions for trade compliant with CUSMA. Outside of petroleum exports (which are down sharply from a year ago largely due to lower oil prices), exports of products specifically targeted by tariffs are down 16% from a year ago in July. However, products that have remained largely duty-free are up 0.5%. Fiscal support: Federal and provincial governments have announced significant economic support packages that are increasingly likely to support growth in the year ahead. Limited layoffs: The unemployment rate rise mostly stems from longer job search times for new entrants. Youth unemployment, in particular, has increased sharply. But growth in unemployed workers due to permanent layoffs has slowed to 4.7% year-over-year in August, down from 19% and 24% in 2023 and 2024, respectively.

These cost pressures are particularly diﬃcult to assess, and there is a risk that they will be more signiﬁcant than anticipated. Factors leading to lower inﬂation include: excess supply and slower growth in unit labour costs easing inﬂation in shelter prices, reﬂecting slower growth in rent prices and mortgage interest costs the recent appreciation of the Canadian dollar In 2027, inﬂation remains close to 2% as the eﬀects of tariﬀs dissipate and excess supply begins to shrink. The composition of inﬂation shifts, with inﬂation in goods prices easing and inﬂation in services prices stabilizing near historical norms. Comparison of recent Bank outlooks Chart 18 compares the current tariﬀ scenario with the January Report and previous Reports. In January, the near-term outlook for inﬂation was higher than in the current tariﬀ scenario because the consumer carbon tax was still in place. The April Report is excluded because it presented a range of scenarios.

GDP growth is approximately 0.5 percentage points lower in both 2025 and 2026 due to the negative eﬀect of tariﬀs and associated uncertainty. Potential output is weaker by the end of 2026 because tariﬀs and uncertainty lead to lower trend labour productivity. 31\n\nOverview US tariﬀs are signiﬁcantly higher than they were at the start of 2025, and US trade policy remains unpredictable. Inﬂation is near 2%, although underlying price pressures have picked up. With uncertainty about US trade policy still high, the outlook for the Canadian economy remains clouded. The global trade conﬂict continues to evolve. Since the time of the April Report, extreme trade tensions between the United States and China have receded. The US administration has reached agreements on tariﬀs with some countries, which have raised US tariﬀs signiﬁcantly from January levels. The United States has also doubled its tariﬀs on imports of steel and aluminum and has threatened high, broad-based tariﬀs on many other trading partners if agreements are not reached soon. Economic scenarios for the outlook At the beginning of 2025, shifting US trade policy increased uncertainty about the economic outlook. This trade-related uncertainty has two layers. The ﬁrst layer is around US trade policy. It is diﬃcult to know what tariﬀs and countermeasures will be imposed, how long tariﬀs will last and how trade negotiations will play out. The second layer of uncertainty is about how households, businesses and governments will react and adapt to tariﬀs. In the April Report, the Bank of Canada presented two illustrative scenarios that explored diﬀerent paths for US trade policy. This was done to address the ﬁrst layer of uncertainty. To address the second layer of uncertainty, the Risks section focused on how the economy would respond to a given level of tariﬀs. Since April, the risk of a severe and escalating global trade conﬂict has diminished, and there is some clarity around what tariﬀs will look like. Nevertheless, how US trade policy will unfold remains highly uncertain. And while recent data have helped reduce some of the uncertainty around the impacts of tariﬀs, it is still too early to conﬁdently project the eﬀects of the tariﬀs on economic growth and inﬂation. In this environment of elevated uncertainty, scenarios continue to be a useful tool for considering potential outcomes. Therefore, the July Report presents an economic scenario conditional on trade policies in place or agreed on as of July 27, 2025—the current tariﬀ scenario—rather than a conventional forecast. This Report also includes two alternative scenarios, one in which tariﬀs are reduced and another in which they are substantially increased—the de-escalation scenario and the escalation scenario, respectively. Taken together, these scenarios encompass a range of paths for trade policy and the Canadian economy. For details on the scenarios, see the Scenario assumptions section. The economic outcomes of the current tariﬀ scenario can be found in the Outlook and Global economy sections. The economic outcomes of the alternative scenarios are explored in In focus: The path of US tari ﬀs remains uncertain. Reﬂecting the high level of uncertainty, the information provided in this Report is somewhat less detailed than in a typical base-case projection. Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4 compare the current tariﬀ scenario to the January Report, which was the last report to present a base-case projection. As in the April Report, risks related to how businesses, households and governments will react and adapt to tariﬀs are examined in the Risks section. Other non-tariﬀ risks are also discussed.

After that, export growth resumes as Canadian exporters adjust to the new trade environment. Imports decline until the ﬁrst quarter of 2026 as counter-tariﬀs and weak business investment reduce demand for inputs from abroad. Import growth then picks up, supported by growth in domestic demand. Domestic demand moderates due to trade pressures The intensifying global conﬂict slows growth in ﬁnal domestic demand in Canada. Household purchasing power weakens because of deteriorating labour market conditions. Less demand from the United States causes some exporters to reduce hours and lay oﬀ workers. Additionally, a decline in Canada’s terms of trade weighs on household incomes, and higher tariﬀs raise the prices of imports, such as food and consumer goods. Business investment falls because of higher import costs and reduced demand for capital goods due to lower exports. However, as the trade environment begins to stabilize, investment growth turns positive. 52\n\nLower tariﬀs increase economic activity GDP in Canada grows around 2% over the second half of 2025 because tariﬀs are reduced (Chart 27). It then averages around 1.7% through the end of 2027. Chart 27: Economic activity picks up in the de-escalation scenario Quarterly data a.

If the trade conﬂict were to escalate or de- escalate, those shifts would alter economic outcomes. Since January, the United States has threatened, imposed, paused and reinstated tariﬀs on many of its trading partners. It has negotiated agreements with some countries, but many others still face threats of signiﬁcant new tariﬀs. These policy shifts have happened quickly and sometimes without warning. As a result, this Report presents a current tariﬀ scenario instead of a base-case projection as well as two alternative scenarios—a de-escalation scenario and an escalation scenario. When taken together, these scenarios encompass a range of potential outcomes. The current tariﬀ scenario is presented in the Outlook and Global economy sections. This section presents the de-escalation and escalation scenarios. In the de-escalation scenario, tariﬀs are lower than in the current tariﬀ scenario, and the degree of trade uncertainty decreases. Compared with the current tariﬀ scenario: economic growth in Canada rebounds faster once tariﬀs are reduced and uncertainty eases inﬂation in Canada is lower over most of the scenario horizon, primarily because tariﬀs are lifted In the escalation scenario, trade negotiations deteriorate, causing tariﬀs to rise signiﬁcantly. Compared with the current tariﬀ scenario: economic growth in Canada slows markedly, with gross domestic product (GDP) about 1.25% lower by the end of the scenario horizon inﬂation rises faster, because of the increase in tariﬀs, to around 2.5% in 2026, before stabilizing around 2% in 2027 De-escalation scenario In this scenario, the United States lowers its tariﬀs against Canada and other countries. In response, China signiﬁcantly reduces its counter-tariﬀs, while Canada removes them. Although uncertainty declines somewhat, it persists due to lingering concerns about the stability of US trade policy (see the Scenario assumptions section). Economic growth in Canada rebounds over the second half of 2025. It then eases to a more moderate pace over the rest of the scenario horizon. GDP growth is stronger than in the current tariﬀ scenario because the removal of tariﬀs and reduced uncertainty lead to stronger growth in exports and domestic demand. The level of GDP is roughly 0.5% higher at the end of the scenario horizon. Consumer price index (CPI) inﬂation stays below the 2% target until late 2026. It then averages around 2% in 2027. Inﬂation in 2026 is lower than in the current tariﬀ scenario because tariﬀs are lifted. 47\n\nb.

This boost can be explained by lower tariﬀs, which result in increased US demand for Canadian exports. Export growth then moderates as the positive impact from the new trade agreement fades. Similarly, import growth in Canada rises sharply over roughly the same time frame, fuelled by robust consumer spending and business investment. However, this momentum slows in 2027. Final domestic demand improves Growth in ﬁnal domestic demand rises and remains robust from the second half of 2025 into the ﬁrst quarter of 2026. Growth in both consumption and residential investment is strong, supported by increases in disposable income. Disposable income rises mostly because of the recovery in export demand, which strengthens labour market conditions. After this initial surge, growth in household spending returns to a more moderate pace. Businesses become more conﬁdent in the strength of demand once tariﬀs are lifted, leading to a surge in business investment over roughly the next year. 49\n\nb.

Potential output growth then picks up in 2026 and 2027, mainly due to more robust trend labour productivity growth. Trend labour input growth remains modest. The output gap persists in 2026 and then narrows in 2027 as GDP growth picks up. Exports rise slowly from current low levels After falling sharply in the second quarter due to tariﬀs, exports stabilize in the second half of 2025.

      "CHAPTER 2 ThE RISE OF ThE SIL vER ECONOMy: GLObAL IMPLICATIONS OF POPULATION A GING 67International Monetary Fund | April 2025 Because the share of individuals ages 65 and older is projected to increase steadily worldwide, relatively fewer workers will be supporting more retirees, stress- ing pay-as-you-go pension plans and public finances. Policymakers can employ different levers to adjust pension plans so that they remain solvent, such as increasing statutory retirement ages, increasing contri- butions from workers or firms, and reducing benefits to pensioners. Policymakers often opt to postpone unavoidable reforms, because the financial pressures from aging accrue slowly. The choice of instruments and their timing, however, can entail uneven reform costs across cohorts and larger costs overall. This box uses the Overlapping Generations and Retirement model (Baksa and Munkacsi 2016) to simulate the impact of pension reforms in a typi- cal advanced economy. This is a dynamic general equilibrium model with demographics, overlapping generations, unemployment, and a rich fiscal sec- tor.1 Population changes over time, with the changes driven by shocks to fertility and mortality. The model tracks the macroeconomic and fiscal implications of aging and fiscal policy separately for two gener- ations: the young, who work (or are unemployed) and pay consumption and labor income taxes (or receive unemployment benefits), and the old, who are retired and receive pension benefits. Population aging causes the labor force to shrink (in relative or absolute terms), which, in turn, drags down the growth rates of consumption, investment, and output. 2 Aggregate consumption and savings are also affected by the fact that workers and retirees have different consumption The authors of this box are Daniel Baksa and Zsuzsa Munkacsi. 1Stylized data on demographics, labor markets, GDP and its components, and the fiscal sector are considered to capture the long-term characteristics of the artificial economy. 2The precise impact is determined by which factor or factors dominate (lower fertility, higher life expectancy, migration, other factors, or a combination of these), as outlined in Baksa, Munkacsi, and Nerlich (2020). and saving patterns. The prospect of living longer can also trigger precautionary saving. Shrinking labor supply can contribute to higher capital-to-labor ratios, reducing the need for further investment, which puts downward pressure on interest rates. Meanwhile, aging carries several fiscal challenges: Pension (and health) spending can climb when the number of retirees rises, whereas a shrinking labor force might imply lower consumption and labor income tax revenues. As a result, aging can push the public-debt-to-GDP ratio upward. The analysis considers three instruments for reform- ing pension plans. In regard to direct effects, higher social security contributions affect the disposable income of young workers, a reduction in the wage replacement rate of pensions means lower benefits for pensioners, and raising the statutory retirement age implies a reduction in the number of retirees relative to the number of workers. Policy changes employing these instruments could also trigger indirect effects through behavioral responses. The analysis considers the impact of each reform separately and when imple- mented jointly as a package, as well as with immediate implementation versus that with a 10-year delay. Each reform scenario is calibrated such that the aging- induced increase in the public-debt-to-GDP ratio is reversed in 75 years (Table 2.2.1). Simulations based on the model indicate that aging would depress per capita consumption for both the young and the old (with a larger decline in the case of the older populations) in the absence of reforms (red bars in Figure 2.2.1), because an increasing level of public debt would need to be serviced. However, the simulations also indicate that consumption losses can be attenuated and shared more equitably across generations if a reform that uses a mix of instruments\n\nWORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A C RITICAL J UNCTURE AMID P OLIC y Sh IFTS 56 International Monetary Fund | April 2025 of a general rise in the “age-friendliness” of today’s jobs (Acemoglu, Mühlbach, and Scott 2022) provides something of a silver lining. Also, occupation-level data suggest that older workers with college educations are relatively well positioned to benefit from the produc- tivity-boosting potential of AI because it complements their tasks and skills (Box 2.3). Overall, these findings suggest that healthy aging can expand the effective labor supply of older indi- viduals through higher labor force participation, employment probability, numbers of hours worked, and productivity. T o assess how healthy aging can mitigate the economic effects of population aging, the next section incorporates these elements into a general equilibrium analysis. Economic Implications of Global Population Aging The economic impact of demographic shifts is multifaceted. First, variations in fertility, mortality, and migration have an impact on both population growth rates and age structures. Given individuals’ typical life cycle—birth, schooling, working, and retirement— chronological age thresholds defining economic activity and retirement relative to life expectancy play a critical role. A rising share of the working-age population (those ages 15–64) boosts labor supply and economic growth, whereas an increasing old-age dependency ratio (number of individuals ages 65 and older relative to the number in the working-age population) weighs on growth and strains public finances on account of higher spending on pensions, health care, and long- term care. These pressures intensify as the lifespan beyond retirement age lengthens.5 Second, the expected length of working lives relative to retirement influences individuals’ saving behavior. If life expectancy increases while the effective retirement age remains unchanged, individuals tend to save more to smooth consumption over their lives, driving up aggregate savings. Moreover, if the within-economy age profiles of wealth and labor income are held fixed, an increasing share of older individuals raises total wealth. 5The subsequent analysis focuses on effective (rather than statutory) retirement age, which has significant macroeconomic implications. Among advanced economies, the median effective retirement age is about 2.5 years lower than the statutory retirement age. However, it varies widely across countries and over time, likely reflecting adjustments to the statutory retirement age, the generosity of pensions, and differences in health status among older workers. At the same time, a shrinking workforce increases capital per worker, reducing investment needs. These forces combine and, on balance, tend to place down- ward pressure on interest rates (Gagnon, Johannsen, and López-Salido 2021; April 2023 World Economic Outlook [WEO], Chapter 2). 6 The uneven pace of these trends across economies due to aging will largely shape their net foreign asset positions (Auclert and others 2024). The general equilibrium effects of aging on both growth and interest rates will have important implications for public finances. Third, beyond chronological age, physiological aging also influences individuals’ labor supply and retirement decisions. In line with findings in the previous section, research suggests that physiological functioning is a key predictor of individuals’ labor force participation and productivity, independent of their chronological age (Kotschy, Bloom, and Scott 2024). Improvements in how individuals age can thus affect education, work, and saving decisions, with broad implications for aggre- gate labor supply, interest rates, and economic growth. Finally, asynchronous aging across countries creates opportunities for efficiency gains from cross- border reallocation of production factors. Capital may flow from old, high-savings economies to younger, capital-scarce economies, shaping external balances (Gourinchas and Rey 2014; Auclert and others 2024). Similarly, labor may gradually migrate from younger, labor-abundant economies to older economies facing labor scarcity. The Model This chapter employs\n\nCHAPTER 2 ThE RISE OF ThE SIL vER ECONOMy: GLObAL IMPLICATIONS OF POPULATION A GING 51International Monetary Fund | April 2025 of older individuals with higher accumulated savings in large economies, is projected to exert downward pressure on interest rates. Still, most countries are likely to face a worse interest-growth differential than in the recent past, and many will need higher primary balances than they registered in 2016–18 to keep debt ratios stable from 2030 onward. Uneven demographic trends are also likely to exert widening pressure on external global posi- tions through the end of the century. • A multifaceted policy approach can increase labor supply, boost growth, and ease fiscal pressures amid global population aging. Lifelong policies to support the human capital of workers in late adulthood (that is, people who are between age 50 and retirement age), including health promotion and prevention measures, can significantly counter the effect of population aging on growth. In addition, raising labor force participation among the 65-and-older age group—by gradually increasing the effective retirement age in line with improvements in life expectancy—and closing gender gaps where they remain large would provide significant growth tailwinds in many countries. A combination of labor supply policies could boost global annual output growth by about 0.6 percentage point over the next 25 years, offsetting almost three-fourths of the drag from demographics during that period. The fiscal dividends from progrowth policies would enable many countries to rebuild buffers and create space for critical spending needs. Expanding access to international financial markets through credit and capital market reforms, alongside stronger gover- nance and institutions, would allow younger, low-in- come countries to reap demographic dividends before the window for doing so closes and offset potential losses from migration outflows to older, labor-scarce economies. The chapter examines the implications of popula- tion aging for growth, interest rates, external balances, and public finances but does not cover all relevant aspects. Notably, it abstracts from shifts in consumer demand and sectoral reallocations driven by aging, as well as the implications for the financial sector, house prices, and urbanization. The analysis also abstracts from endogenous technological responses to aging— such as automation and artificial intelligence (AI)— which could mitigate some of the negative growth effects. Uneven Pace of Global Population Aging Advancements in health care, public health mea- sures, and improvements in living standards in past decades have contributed to significant declines in mortality rates across the world. Lower mortality rates in middle and old age have resulted in significant increases in life expectancy and longevity. These trends, together with falling birth rates, are leading to signifi- cant changes in the age structure of economies. Under current demographic projections, econo- mies around the world are progressively crossing their “demographic turning point”—the year when the share of the working-age population in their total popula- tion begins to decline—typically marking a transition from a demographic dividend to a demographic drag (Bloom, Canning, and Sevilla 2003). By 2035, all advanced economies and the largest emerging markets will have crossed this threshold (Figure 2.2, panel 1). By 2070, most low-income countries will have experi- enced similar shifts. At the same time, increased longevity is contrib- uting to the rise of the silver economy, because the share of the older population is projected to increase rapidly (Figure 2.2, panel 2). Although the rise in the share of older individuals is steepest in the “early agers”—including the largest advanced economies and emerging markets in Europe and Asia—the relatively younger Latin American economies, as well as the world’s youngest regions (Africa and the Middle East), will also experience a sharp rise in the share of the older population. Aging is no longer a concern limited to advanced economies; it is a universal trend whose implications all countries will navigate throughout this\n\nWORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A C RITICAL J UNCTURE AMID P OLIC y Sh IFTS 50 International Monetary Fund | April 2025 • Healthy aging: Is there evidence that individuals in later-born cohorts are healthier than those in earlier-born cohorts at the same age? How do healthy-aging trends differ across countries and socioeconomic groups? Has healthy aging increased the labor market attachment and productivity of older individuals? • Economic implications of global population aging: What are the likely implications of population aging for growth, interest rates, public finances, and external balances? How do these implications differ across countries given uneven demographic trends? T o what extent can longer and more productive working lives as a result of healthy aging offset the economic and fiscal challenges of population aging? • The role of policies: How can policies help generate growth tailwinds to mitigate the adverse economic impacts of demographic transitions? T o answer these questions, the chapter first relies on microsurvey data from approximately 1 million individuals from 29 advanced and 12 emerging market economies over 2000–22 to establish the extent of healthy-aging trends and their association with labor market outcomes. It then employs a multicountry, overlapping-generations general equilibrium model cov- ering 69 economies—representing about two-thirds of global output and the world’s population—to assess the economic implications of global aging through the end of the century. After baseline projections under current policies are established, the model is used to assess the potential impact of targeted progrowth policies to cush- ion against the growth and fiscal implications of aging. The chapter’s main findings are as follows: • Economies worldwide are aging rapidly as a result of declining fertility and rising life expectancy, with the pace of aging varying significantly across regions. No longer confined to advanced economies, aging is accelerating in many emerging market and mid- dle-income economies. Meanwhile, the window for reaping demographic dividends in younger, low-in- come countries is gradually closing. • In many countries, people not only are living longer but are also aging in better health, which is associated with longer and more productive working lives. Alongside increases in longevity, the functional capacity of older individuals has improved over time. More recent cohorts of older individuals are physically stronger and cognitively abler than earlier cohorts at the same age. Notably, when cognitive capacities are the focus, “the 70s are the new 50s”: Data from a sample of 41 advanced and emerging market econo- mies indicate that, on average, a person who was 70 in 2022 had the same cognitive ability as a 53-year- old in 2000. Over the course of a decade, this pace of improvement in cognitive abilities is associated with an increase of approximately 20 percentage points in the likelihood that individuals remain engaged in the labor market, either by working or actively seeking employment, along with an increase of about six hours in average weekly hours worked and a 30 percent rise in labor earnings, conditional on being employed. • Although healthy aging will partly offset the negative impact of demographic headwinds, the growth of global output will slow significantly through the 21st century, and many countries will need sizable efforts to stabilize public-debt-to-GDP ratios. Ongoing increases in the labor supply and improvements in the human capital of older individuals because of healthy aging are expected to contribute about 0.4 percentage point annually to global GDP growth over 2025–50. Despite this tailwind, average global annual output growth under current policies is pro- jected to decline by 1.1 percentage points during the same period, compared with the 2016–18 average. Demographic trends alone are expected to account for almost three-fourths of this decline.

Importantly, this healthier-aging trend has also been associated with higher labor force participa- tion rates, a higher likelihood of being employed, and higher labor earnings for individuals ages 50 and older. Nevertheless, population aging, together with other forces such as waning catch-up growth in large emerging market economies, is expected to depress global economic growth. Even as ongoing gains from healthy aging are estimated to boost annual global growth by about 0.4 percentage point over 2025–50, the analysis in this chapter indicates that under current policies global output growth would decline on average by about 2 percentage points through the end of the century. With lower growth prospects and historically high levels of public debt, many countries will need significant fiscal efforts to keep debt-to-GDP ratios stable beyond 2030. A multifaceted policy approach is essential to deal with these challenges. Broad-based improvement in the functional capacity of individuals ages 50 and older over the past few decades shows that aging can be a malleable process (Scott 2023). Policies aimed at improving the human capital of older workers can enhance productivity and narrow the participation gap with prime-age workers. Emphasizing health promotion and prevention policies is warranted, and these policies need to be carefully deployed to address health inequalities. Measures that tackle behavioral risk factors throughout the course of life—such as tobacco smoking, harmful alcohol use, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diets—and other risk factors related to the environment and mental health can decrease the incidence of chronic diseases and health inequalities (Liu and others 2016; Rashbrook 2019; Lee, Park, and Lee 2020; Hacker 2024). Examples include immuni- zation, regular health checks, screenings for chronic diseases, campaigns to prevent substance abuse, tax- ation (for example, on tobacco and unhealthy food), regulations (for example, those to promote smoke-free environments), and providing access to mental health resources. These measures often span beyond the health care sector and are not necessarily costly. Evi- dence suggests many are cost-effective and can produce savings by reducing expenditure on health intervention down the road (McDaid, Sassi, and Merkur 2015; OECD 2015). Yet spending on health promotion and prevention accounts for only 1–6 percent of total health expenditure in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Devel- opment and tends to be cut disproportionately during downturns (Gmeinder, Morgan, and Mueller 2017; Hacker 2024). A comprehensive approach, combining pension reforms, training, and workplace adaptations, should complement health-oriented interventions to increase effective retirement ages in line with improvements in life expectancy. Besides changes to statutory retirement ages, reducing early retirement benefits, introducing incentives to postpone retirement, and allowing for phased retirement can induce a rise in effective retire- ment age. Pension system reforms need to balance sustainability with adequate protection to mitigate old-age poverty and inequality (Amaglobeli and others 2019). More broadly, the malleability of aging and the diversity in health status and experience among older workers suggest that age-based provisions in policies are likely to be inefficient and should be reconsidered (see discussion in Scott 2023). Also, lifelong upskilling and reskilling programs are crucial to ensure individ- uals remain employable as they age. This becomes even more important at the cusp of a potential AI revolution, in which skilled older workers will be well positioned to reap the benefits given the complemen- tarity of their skills with AI, whereas unskilled workers may struggle to keep their jobs or manage successful job transitions (Box 2.3).

Also, occupation-level data suggest that older workers with college educations are relatively well positioned to benefit from the produc- tivity-boosting potential of AI because it complements their tasks and skills (Box 2.3). Overall, these findings suggest that healthy aging can expand the effective labor supply of older indi- viduals through higher labor force participation, employment probability, numbers of hours worked, and productivity. T o assess how healthy aging can mitigate the economic effects of population aging, the next section incorporates these elements into a general equilibrium analysis. Economic Implications of Global Population Aging The economic impact of demographic shifts is multifaceted. First, variations in fertility, mortality, and migration have an impact on both population growth rates and age structures. Given individuals’ typical life cycle—birth, schooling, working, and retirement— chronological age thresholds defining economic activity and retirement relative to life expectancy play a critical role. A rising share of the working-age population (those ages 15–64) boosts labor supply and economic growth, whereas an increasing old-age dependency ratio (number of individuals ages 65 and older relative to the number in the working-age population) weighs on growth and strains public finances on account of higher spending on pensions, health care, and long- term care. These pressures intensify as the lifespan beyond retirement age lengthens.5 Second, the expected length of working lives relative to retirement influences individuals’ saving behavior. If life expectancy increases while the effective retirement age remains unchanged, individuals tend to save more to smooth consumption over their lives, driving up aggregate savings. Moreover, if the within-economy age profiles of wealth and labor income are held fixed, an increasing share of older individuals raises total wealth. 5The subsequent analysis focuses on effective (rather than statutory) retirement age, which has significant macroeconomic implications. Among advanced economies, the median effective retirement age is about 2.5 years lower than the statutory retirement age. However, it varies widely across countries and over time, likely reflecting adjustments to the statutory retirement age, the generosity of pensions, and differences in health status among older workers. At the same time, a shrinking workforce increases capital per worker, reducing investment needs. These forces combine and, on balance, tend to place down- ward pressure on interest rates (Gagnon, Johannsen, and López-Salido 2021; April 2023 World Economic Outlook [WEO], Chapter 2). 6 The uneven pace of these trends across economies due to aging will largely shape their net foreign asset positions (Auclert and others 2024). The general equilibrium effects of aging on both growth and interest rates will have important implications for public finances. Third, beyond chronological age, physiological aging also influences individuals’ labor supply and retirement decisions. In line with findings in the previous section, research suggests that physiological functioning is a key predictor of individuals’ labor force participation and productivity, independent of their chronological age (Kotschy, Bloom, and Scott 2024). Improvements in how individuals age can thus affect education, work, and saving decisions, with broad implications for aggre- gate labor supply, interest rates, and economic growth. Finally, asynchronous aging across countries creates opportunities for efficiency gains from cross- border reallocation of production factors. Capital may flow from old, high-savings economies to younger, capital-scarce economies, shaping external balances (Gourinchas and Rey 2014; Auclert and others 2024). Similarly, labor may gradually migrate from younger, labor-abundant economies to older economies facing labor scarcity. The Model This chapter employs\n\nCHAPTER 2 ThE RISE OF ThE SIL vER ECONOMy: GLObAL IMPLICATIONS OF POPULATION A GING 51International Monetary Fund | April 2025 of older individuals with higher accumulated savings in large economies, is projected to exert downward pressure on interest rates. Still, most countries are likely to face a worse interest-growth differential than in the recent past, and many will need higher primary balances than they registered in 2016–18 to keep debt ratios stable from 2030 onward. Uneven demographic trends are also likely to exert widening pressure on external global posi- tions through the end of the century. • A multifaceted policy approach can increase labor supply, boost growth, and ease fiscal pressures amid global population aging. Lifelong policies to support the human capital of workers in late adulthood (that is, people who are between age 50 and retirement age), including health promotion and prevention measures, can significantly counter the effect of population aging on growth.

In the group of emerging market and developing economies, China will witness a particularly sharp decline in its GDP growth over 2025–50—a deceler- ation of 2.7 percentage points relative to the 2016–18 average—reflecting acutely adverse demographics, as well as the approaching end of the era of rapid catch-up to frontier productivity. India, with its rela- tively favorable near-term demographics, is projected to experience a smaller growth decline in 2025–50 (of about 0.7 percentage point), but the decline will intensify over 2050–2100 as the country passes its demographic turning point. Low-income countries are also expected to see a sharper deceleration in growth in the second half of the century, once demographic dividends turn into headwinds. The projected slowdown is generally smaller in regard to output per capita, but most economies will see a deceleration going forward. For the world aver- age, and relative to 2016–18, output per capita growth will be about 0.6 percentage point lower in 2025–50 and 1.8 percentage points lower toward the end of the century. Lower expected growth, combined with an increas- ing share of older populations, would reduce the need for additional investments and push up desired aggregate savings, resulting in downward pressure on interest rates.8 However, the interest-growth differ- ential (r – g) projected for the next 25 years is higher than the 2016–18 average for all economies except India and the LIC bloc—meaning that, all else equal, a higher primary balance would be needed to keep debt ratios stable. Average r – g for the world is projected to be 1 percentage point higher in 2025–50 than in 2016–18, moderating to about 0.5 percentage point toward the end of the century as population aging increases global savings relative to investment demand everywhere. Early- (late-)aging countries will see r – g pressures easing (increasing) toward the end of the 8It is conceivable that investment rates may not fall by much if aging-induced labor scarcity fosters investment in labor-saving technologies (Goodhart and Pradhan 2020). If automation or AI adoption responds endogenously to an aging population, interest rates could face upward pressure, either from sufficiently large productivity gains (Stähler 2021) or an increase in the capital share in output (Moll, Rachel, and Restrepo 2022). These channels are not accounted for in the model. century as aggregate savings and wealth evolve along with the transition. T o keep debt-to-GDP ratios stable from 2030 onward, about half of the model economies are pro- jected to need higher primary-balance-to-GDP ratios than they had on average over 2016–18. Importantly, this group includes the largest economies, such as China, Japan, and the United States. The larger required fiscal effort reflects the combination of adverse demographics and the large increase in public debt many countries have experienced since the onset of the pandemic.9 The uneven demographic trends would influence the direction of future capital flows and contribute to divergent net foreign asset positions across the world over the long run. Large emerging market economies (China and India) would accumulate foreign assets, especially over 2050–2100, whereas many advanced economies would gradually draw down foreign assets throughout the projection horizon (Figure 2.10). The net foreign asset position for the LIC bloc would 9The model accounts for the implications of aging for pension spending but does not include other age-related health care\n\n2.2, panel 2). Although the rise in the share of older individuals is steepest in the “early agers”—including the largest advanced economies and emerging markets in Europe and Asia—the relatively younger Latin American economies, as well as the world’s youngest regions (Africa and the Middle East), will also experience a sharp rise in the share of the older population. Aging is no longer a concern limited to advanced economies; it is a universal trend whose implications all countries will navigate throughout this century. And the window for low-income countries to reap demo- graphic dividends is gradually closing. Healthy Aging and Implications for Labor Markets Because longevity is a key driver of changes in the age structure of economies, an important question is whether individuals are aging in better health. Is there evidence that the functional ability of older individuals has been increasing over time? How broad-based are these gains across different economies? And what are the implications for labor markets? T o tackle these questions, this section uses micro- data from surveys of individuals ages 50 and above,"

      "(Online Annex Figure 2.2.6). This suggests that even if the functional capacity of older individuals improves, other factors—such as skills obsolescence, pension incentives, and age discrimination—can still constrain their attachment to the labor market (Neumark, Burn, and Button 2019; D’Albis 2023). However, evidence 4Qualitatively similar results are obtained when using an aug- mented inverse-probability-weighting approach, in which chronic disease cases that are less predictable (that is, more random)—based on individuals’ socioeconomic characteristics and health behaviors— are given a higher weight, and when using the composite health measure of frailty that averages various measured and self-reported health indicators (Online Annex 2.2).

T o shed light on this, the analysis investigates the effect of health indicators capturing the functional capacity of older individuals on measures of labor supply and labor earnings. A simple regression analysis reveals that higher scores on the health indicators are associated with increased total labor earnings and labor productivity (proxied by hourly earnings), as well as with posi- tive employment outcomes along both the extensive margin (labor force participation) and intensive margin (hours worked); see Online Annex Table 2.2.3. However, these associations may not necessarily reflect causal relationships. Some studies have argued that increasing the retirement age negatively affects health outcomes, especially for those in low-status occupa- tions (Barschkett and others 2022; Abeliansky and Strulik 2023), in which case the estimated correla- tions between the two would need to be interpreted as lower bounds. Others find that working longer is beneficial for most people but negative for some, especially those in low-quality jobs (Calvo 2006). In addition, there could be unobserved drivers of both health and labor market outcomes that would bias the relationship between the two. T o address these concerns, the analysis here employs an instrumental-variables approach that exploits exogenous health shocks, proxied by the development of chronic diseases.3 Given that smoking, poor nutrition, physical inactivity, and excessive alcohol use are key risk factors for most chronic diseases (Hacker 2024), the regression employed in the analysis con- trols for these lifestyle behaviors. The estimates remain statistically significant and are quantitatively larger than the simple correlations (Figure 2.8). In regard to economic magnitude, the results imply that average cognitive health gains observed for older-age individ- uals over a decade are associated with rises in labor earnings and labor productivity by about 30 percent, an increase in their likelihood of participating in the labor force by about 20 percentage points, and higher numbers of average weekly hours worked by about 3The identification strategy rests on the assumption that at least some chronic diseases—those unexplained by individuals’ socioeco- nomic characteristics and health behaviors—occur randomly. Using alternative approaches to identify health shocks, previous studies have demonstrated that sudden changes in health can induce older workers to reduce their labor supply or retire (Bound and others 1999; Riphahn 1999; Disney, Emmerson, and Wakefield 2006) and force younger individuals into inactivity (García-Gómez and López- Nicolás 2006; García-Gómez, Jones, and Rice 2010), and that the employment effects may persist over many years (García-Gómez and others 2013). six hours. In addition, better health is also associated with later retirement, working more weeks per year, and a lower probability of being unemployed, and qualitatively similar relationships hold for other health indicators (Online Annex Table 2.2.4).4 Although healthy-aging gains have been compara- ble across age groups, the labor market impact of a given improvement in health does vary with age. For instance, the impact of better health on labor force participation of individuals in their 50s is significantly larger than that for individuals in their 60s and 70s (Online Annex Figure 2.2.6). This suggests that even if the functional capacity of older individuals improves, other factors—such as skills obsolescence, pension incentives, and age discrimination—can still constrain their attachment to the labor market (Neumark, Burn, and Button 2019; D’Albis 2023).

Measures that tackle behavioral risk factors throughout the course of life—such as tobacco smoking, harmful alcohol use, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diets—and other risk factors related to the environment and mental health can decrease the incidence of chronic diseases and health inequalities (Liu and others 2016; Rashbrook 2019; Lee, Park, and Lee 2020; Hacker 2024). Examples include immuni- zation, regular health checks, screenings for chronic diseases, campaigns to prevent substance abuse, tax- ation (for example, on tobacco and unhealthy food), regulations (for example, those to promote smoke-free environments), and providing access to mental health resources. These measures often span beyond the health care sector and are not necessarily costly. Evi- dence suggests many are cost-effective and can produce savings by reducing expenditure on health intervention down the road (McDaid, Sassi, and Merkur 2015; OECD 2015). Yet spending on health promotion and prevention accounts for only 1–6 percent of total health expenditure in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Devel- opment and tends to be cut disproportionately during downturns (Gmeinder, Morgan, and Mueller 2017; Hacker 2024). A comprehensive approach, combining pension reforms, training, and workplace adaptations, should complement health-oriented interventions to increase effective retirement ages in line with improvements in life expectancy. Besides changes to statutory retirement ages, reducing early retirement benefits, introducing incentives to postpone retirement, and allowing for phased retirement can induce a rise in effective retire- ment age. Pension system reforms need to balance sustainability with adequate protection to mitigate old-age poverty and inequality (Amaglobeli and others 2019). More broadly, the malleability of aging and the diversity in health status and experience among older workers suggest that age-based provisions in policies are likely to be inefficient and should be reconsidered (see discussion in Scott 2023). Also, lifelong upskilling and reskilling programs are crucial to ensure individ- uals remain employable as they age. This becomes even more important at the cusp of a potential AI revolution, in which skilled older workers will be well positioned to reap the benefits given the complemen- tarity of their skills with AI, whereas unskilled workers may struggle to keep their jobs or manage successful job transitions (Box 2.3).

T o assess how healthy aging can mitigate the economic effects of population aging, the next section incorporates these elements into a general equilibrium analysis. Economic Implications of Global Population Aging The economic impact of demographic shifts is multifaceted. First, variations in fertility, mortality, and migration have an impact on both population growth rates and age structures. Given individuals’ typical life cycle—birth, schooling, working, and retirement— chronological age thresholds defining economic activity and retirement relative to life expectancy play a critical role. A rising share of the working-age population (those ages 15–64) boosts labor supply and economic growth, whereas an increasing old-age dependency ratio (number of individuals ages 65 and older relative to the number in the working-age population) weighs on growth and strains public finances on account of higher spending on pensions, health care, and long- term care. These pressures intensify as the lifespan beyond retirement age lengthens.5 Second, the expected length of working lives relative to retirement influences individuals’ saving behavior. If life expectancy increases while the effective retirement age remains unchanged, individuals tend to save more to smooth consumption over their lives, driving up aggregate savings. Moreover, if the within-economy age profiles of wealth and labor income are held fixed, an increasing share of older individuals raises total wealth. 5The subsequent analysis focuses on effective (rather than statutory) retirement age, which has significant macroeconomic implications. Among advanced economies, the median effective retirement age is about 2.5 years lower than the statutory retirement age. However, it varies widely across countries and over time, likely reflecting adjustments to the statutory retirement age, the generosity of pensions, and differences in health status among older workers. At the same time, a shrinking workforce increases capital per worker, reducing investment needs. These forces combine and, on balance, tend to place down- ward pressure on interest rates (Gagnon, Johannsen, and López-Salido 2021; April 2023 World Economic Outlook [WEO], Chapter 2). 6 The uneven pace of these trends across economies due to aging will largely shape their net foreign asset positions (Auclert and others 2024). The general equilibrium effects of aging on both growth and interest rates will have important implications for public finances. Third, beyond chronological age, physiological aging also influences individuals’ labor supply and retirement decisions. In line with findings in the previous section, research suggests that physiological functioning is a key predictor of individuals’ labor force participation and productivity, independent of their chronological age (Kotschy, Bloom, and Scott 2024). Improvements in how individuals age can thus affect education, work, and saving decisions, with broad implications for aggre- gate labor supply, interest rates, and economic growth. Finally, asynchronous aging across countries creates opportunities for efficiency gains from cross- border reallocation of production factors. Capital may flow from old, high-savings economies to younger, capital-scarce economies, shaping external balances (Gourinchas and Rey 2014; Auclert and others 2024).

Although the rise in the share of older individuals is steepest in the “early agers”—including the largest advanced economies and emerging markets in Europe and Asia—the relatively younger Latin American economies, as well as the world’s youngest regions (Africa and the Middle East), will also experience a sharp rise in the share of the older population. Aging is no longer a concern limited to advanced economies; it is a universal trend whose implications all countries will navigate throughout this century. And the window for low-income countries to reap demo- graphic dividends is gradually closing. Healthy Aging and Implications for Labor Markets Because longevity is a key driver of changes in the age structure of economies, an important question is whether individuals are aging in better health. Is there evidence that the functional ability of older individuals has been increasing over time? How broad-based are these gains across different economies? And what are the implications for labor markets? T o tackle these questions, this section uses micro- data from surveys of individuals ages 50 and above,\n\nWORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A C RITICAL J UNCTURE AMID P OLIC y Sh IFTS 54 International Monetary Fund | April 2025 individuals from emerging market economies are lower than those from advanced economies after indi- viduals’ socioeconomic characteristics are controlled for (Figure 2.6). Within countries, health disparities are related to socioeconomic characteristics. Average health scores are significantly lower for individuals in rural locations, individuals with at most primary education, and lower-wealth households (Figure 2.6). In turn, although faster improvements in healthy aging in emerging markets (compared with advanced economies) suggest some cross-country “catching up,” the pace of health improvements across other dimensions has been similar despite widely varying initial conditions (Figure 2.7). This indicates that existing socioeconomic health disparities—related to gender, location, education, and wealth—have persisted.2 Further analysis reveals that lifestyle factors, such as levels of physical activity, body mass 2Similarly, Old and Scott (2023) find that frailty has decreased over time in the United Kingdom, though at varying rates across socioeconomic groups, with the wealthiest experiencing the largest decreases. Abeliansky and Strulik (2019) show that health deficits have declined over time in a sample of European countries, but health inequalities have persisted. Abeliansky, Erel, and Strulik (2020) find that the time trend of health improvements in the United States is similar across regions and for men and women, but significantly lower for African Americans compared with Caucasians. index, and smoking, are significant determinants of the functional capacity of older individuals after age and socioeconomic characteristics are controlled for (Online Annex 2.2). In summary, although there is some evidence of cross-country convergence, notable disparities in the physical and cognitive capabilities of older individuals persist, both within and across countries. Strength- ening health care quality and expanding access, particularly for preventive care and for disadvantaged groups, and providing incentives for healthy lifestyles can help narrow these healthy-aging gaps. Singapore’s remarkable increase in life expectancy, from 90th in the world in 1950 to first in 2018, underscores the variety of policies that can be effective, including subsidizing healthier food options, regulating sugar content in beverages, building widespread public fitness centers, introducing automobile congestion charges, and subsidizing housing in proximity to fam- ily to promote intergenerational social connections (Buettner 2012).

Gains from deeper financial integra- tion can also offset the labor losses from migration outflows toward advanced economies, in which the additional workers can boost labor supply and output amidst an aging and dwindling workforce (see Chapter 3). The simulations in this chapter suggest that a combination of policies for boosting labor supply could attenuate the slowdown in global growth over 2025–50 resulting from demographic headwinds by almost three-fourths. Although these progrowth policies could also contribute to higher global interest rates, they would nonetheless provide substantial fiscal dividends. Many countries would be able to rebuild fiscal buffers and create additional fiscal space to finance critical spending. Some economies, however, would still require additional fiscal efforts given the current precarious state of their public finances. In those cases, an early, gradual, and sustained effort is crucial to ensuring intergenerational fairness (Box 2.2) and maintaining economic stability amid ongoing demographic transitions. Although policies to boost labor supply and facil- itate cross-country factor mobility are key, they are not a substitute for efforts to reignite technological innovation and productivity growth—the ultimate driver of improvements in living standards. Structural reforms to promote market competition, financial accessibility, and labor market flexibility can boost pro- ductivity growth by fostering innovation, facilitating a more efficient allocation of capital and labor across firms (see Budina and others 2023; April 2024 WEO, Chapter 3). They can also help countries benefit from technological advances such as AI-related technologies, which are complementary to labor in occupations more typical of older workers (Box 2.3) and can pro- vide the latter with skills and methods for coping with functional decline due to aging (Abril-Jimenez and others 2022). T echnological progress and innovation can be import- ant not only for countering the adverse effects of pop- ulation aging on output growth, but also for enhancing the malleability of aging itself. Promoting research and development in the scientific understanding of biologi- cal aging has the potential to further extend healthy lon- gevity in the decades ahead (Cox 2022). Furthermore, AI-based solutions in health care hold potential for transformation through scaling up of preventive health practices (Chan and others 2024), for instance by auto- mating routine tasks such as screening and diagnostics. They can also bring clinical expertise to underserved and remote areas, helping to reduce the heterogeneity in physical and cognitive capabilities of older individuals documented in this chapter. For example, the Aravind Eye Care System in India has deployed AI-based tools to screen millions of retinal images for diabetic retinopathy, effectively addressing the country’s shortage of ophthal- mologists and preventing vision loss among patients (Yu, Beam, and Kohane 2018). Ultimately, the rise of the silver economy brings both challenges and opportunities, making a compre- hensive and proactive policy approach essential for navigating the challenges of population aging while harnessing the benefits of longer, healthier lives."

Importantly, this healthier-aging trend has also been associated with higher labor force participa- tion rates, a higher likelihood of being employed, and higher labor earnings for individuals ages 50 and older. Nevertheless, population aging, together with other forces such as waning catch-up growth in large emerging market economies, is expected to depress global economic growth. Even as ongoing gains from healthy aging are estimated to boost annual global growth by about 0.4 percentage point over 2025–50, the analysis in this chapter indicates that under current policies global output growth would decline on average by about 2 percentage points through the end of the century. With lower growth prospects and historically high levels of public debt, many countries will need significant fiscal efforts to keep debt-to-GDP ratios stable beyond 2030. A multifaceted policy approach is essential to deal with these challenges. Broad-based improvement in the functional capacity of individuals ages 50 and older over the past few decades shows that aging can be a malleable process (Scott 2023). Policies aimed at improving the human capital of older workers can enhance productivity and narrow the participation gap with prime-age workers.

Economic Implications of Global Population Aging The economic impact of demographic shifts is multifaceted. First, variations in fertility, mortality, and migration have an impact on both population growth rates and age structures. Given individuals’ typical life cycle—birth, schooling, working, and retirement— chronological age thresholds defining economic activity and retirement relative to life expectancy play a critical role. A rising share of the working-age population (those ages 15–64) boosts labor supply and economic growth, whereas an increasing old-age dependency ratio (number of individuals ages 65 and older relative to the number in the working-age population) weighs on growth and strains public finances on account of higher spending on pensions, health care, and long- term care. These pressures intensify as the lifespan beyond retirement age lengthens.5 Second, the expected length of working lives relative to retirement influences individuals’ saving behavior. If life expectancy increases while the effective retirement age remains unchanged, individuals tend to save more to smooth consumption over their lives, driving up aggregate savings. Moreover, if the within-economy age profiles of wealth and labor income are held fixed, an increasing share of older individuals raises total wealth. 5The subsequent analysis focuses on effective (rather than statutory) retirement age, which has significant macroeconomic implications. Among advanced economies, the median effective retirement age is about 2.5 years lower than the statutory retirement age. However, it varies widely across countries and over time, likely reflecting adjustments to the statutory retirement age, the generosity of pensions, and differences in health status among older workers. At the same time, a shrinking workforce increases capital per worker, reducing investment needs. These forces combine and, on balance, tend to place down- ward pressure on interest rates (Gagnon, Johannsen, and López-Salido 2021; April 2023 World Economic Outlook [WEO], Chapter 2). 6 The uneven pace of these trends across economies due to aging will largely shape their net foreign asset positions (Auclert and others 2024). The general equilibrium effects of aging on both growth and interest rates will have important implications for public finances. Third, beyond chronological age, physiological aging also influences individuals’ labor supply and retirement decisions. In line with findings in the previous section, research suggests that physiological functioning is a key predictor of individuals’ labor force participation and productivity, independent of their chronological age (Kotschy, Bloom, and Scott 2024). Improvements in how individuals age can thus affect education, work, and saving decisions, with broad implications for aggre- gate labor supply, interest rates, and economic growth.

The Model This chapter employs\n\nCHAPTER 2 ThE RISE OF ThE SIL vER ECONOMy: GLObAL IMPLICATIONS OF POPULATION A GING 67International Monetary Fund | April 2025 Because the share of individuals ages 65 and older is projected to increase steadily worldwide, relatively fewer workers will be supporting more retirees, stress- ing pay-as-you-go pension plans and public finances. Policymakers can employ different levers to adjust pension plans so that they remain solvent, such as increasing statutory retirement ages, increasing contri- butions from workers or firms, and reducing benefits to pensioners. Policymakers often opt to postpone unavoidable reforms, because the financial pressures from aging accrue slowly. The choice of instruments and their timing, however, can entail uneven reform costs across cohorts and larger costs overall. This box uses the Overlapping Generations and Retirement model (Baksa and Munkacsi 2016) to simulate the impact of pension reforms in a typi- cal advanced economy. This is a dynamic general equilibrium model with demographics, overlapping generations, unemployment, and a rich fiscal sec- tor.1 Population changes over time, with the changes driven by shocks to fertility and mortality. The model tracks the macroeconomic and fiscal implications of aging and fiscal policy separately for two gener- ations: the young, who work (or are unemployed) and pay consumption and labor income taxes (or receive unemployment benefits), and the old, who are retired and receive pension benefits. Population aging causes the labor force to shrink (in relative or absolute terms), which, in turn, drags down the growth rates of consumption, investment, and output. 2 Aggregate consumption and savings are also affected by the fact that workers and retirees have different consumption The authors of this box are Daniel Baksa and Zsuzsa Munkacsi. 1Stylized data on demographics, labor markets, GDP and its components, and the fiscal sector are considered to capture the long-term characteristics of the artificial economy. 2The precise impact is determined by which factor or factors dominate (lower fertility, higher life expectancy, migration, other factors, or a combination of these), as outlined in Baksa, Munkacsi, and Nerlich (2020). and saving patterns. The prospect of living longer can also trigger precautionary saving. Shrinking labor supply can contribute to higher capital-to-labor ratios, reducing the need for further investment, which puts downward pressure on interest rates. Meanwhile, aging carries several fiscal challenges: Pension (and health) spending can climb when the number of retirees rises, whereas a shrinking labor force might imply lower consumption and labor income tax revenues. As a result, aging can push the public-debt-to-GDP ratio upward. The analysis considers three instruments for reform- ing pension plans. In regard to direct effects, higher social security contributions affect the disposable income of young workers, a reduction in the wage replacement rate of pensions means lower benefits for pensioners, and raising the statutory retirement age implies a reduction in the number of retirees relative to the number of workers. Policy changes employing these instruments could also trigger indirect effects through behavioral responses. The analysis considers the impact of each reform separately and when imple- mented jointly as a package, as well as with immediate implementation versus that with a 10-year delay. Each reform scenario is calibrated such that the aging- induced increase in the public-debt-to-GDP ratio is reversed in 75 years (Table 2.2.1). Simulations based on the model indicate that aging would depress per capita consumption for both the young and the old (with a larger decline in the case of the older populations) in the absence of reforms (red bars in Figure 2.2.1), because an increasing level of public debt would need to be serviced. However, the simulations also indicate that consumption losses can be attenuated and shared more equitably across generations if a reform that uses a mix of instruments\n\nWORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A C RITICAL J UNCTURE AMID P OLIC y Sh IFTS 68 International Monetary Fund | April 2025 be needed if the reform is implemented immedi- ately (Table 2.2.1). However, under a combined reform scenario, the increase in retirement age could be less, at two years. • The consumption losses from reforms that rely on a single instrument are significantly larger than those when a mix of instruments is used, at least for one of the generations (Figure 2.2.1). Combining the three measures helps ensure the burden is shared across the young and old, potentially contributing to the acceptability and feasibility of reforms (see also the October 2024 World Economic Outlook, Chapter 3, and the April 2025 Fiscal Monitor, Chapter 2). • The size of required fiscal measures is more profound and aggregate consumption losses are larger when the reforms are postponed for 10 years compared with those in a scenario in which they are implemented immediately. For instance, containing the rise in public debt induced by aging requires a 6-year increase in the retirement age if the reform is carried out immediately, but an 8-year increase is needed if the reform is postponed by 10 years. Moreover, the consumption losses from postponing reforms usually fall disproportionately on the young compared with the old. In summary, policymakers should act sooner rather than later, using a combination of tools to ensure a fairer distribution of the burden across generations and by doing so enhance the feasibility and accept- ability of pension reforms. Although the exercise here is calibrated for a typical advanced economy, with a population that has already aged significantly, the lessons are even more pertinent for emerging market economies and low-income developing countries. As of today, their old-age dependency ratios are lower than those of advanced economies. However, they will experience a faster pace of population aging than did the latter, which means they will have less time to react.

However, the future direction of interest rates is also shaped by other factors influ- encing investment demand, such as future productivity trends as well as public spending to tackle pressing policy issues such as climate change or national security.\n\nCHAPTER 2 ThE RISE OF ThE SIL vER ECONOMy: GLObAL IMPLICATIONS OF POPULATION A GING 67International Monetary Fund | April 2025 Because the share of individuals ages 65 and older is projected to increase steadily worldwide, relatively fewer workers will be supporting more retirees, stress- ing pay-as-you-go pension plans and public finances. Policymakers can employ different levers to adjust pension plans so that they remain solvent, such as increasing statutory retirement ages, increasing contri- butions from workers or firms, and reducing benefits to pensioners. Policymakers often opt to postpone unavoidable reforms, because the financial pressures from aging accrue slowly. The choice of instruments and their timing, however, can entail uneven reform costs across cohorts and larger costs overall. This box uses the Overlapping Generations and Retirement model (Baksa and Munkacsi 2016) to simulate the impact of pension reforms in a typi- cal advanced economy. This is a dynamic general equilibrium model with demographics, overlapping generations, unemployment, and a rich fiscal sec- tor.1 Population changes over time, with the changes driven by shocks to fertility and mortality. The model tracks the macroeconomic and fiscal implications of aging and fiscal policy separately for two gener- ations: the young, who work (or are unemployed) and pay consumption and labor income taxes (or receive unemployment benefits), and the old, who are retired and receive pension benefits. Population aging causes the labor force to shrink (in relative or absolute terms), which, in turn, drags down the growth rates of consumption, investment, and output. 2 Aggregate consumption and savings are also affected by the fact that workers and retirees have different consumption The authors of this box are Daniel Baksa and Zsuzsa Munkacsi. 1Stylized data on demographics, labor markets, GDP and its components, and the fiscal sector are considered to capture the long-term characteristics of the artificial economy. 2The precise impact is determined by which factor or factors dominate (lower fertility, higher life expectancy, migration, other factors, or a combination of these), as outlined in Baksa, Munkacsi, and Nerlich (2020). and saving patterns. The prospect of living longer can also trigger precautionary saving. Shrinking labor supply can contribute to higher capital-to-labor ratios, reducing the need for further investment, which puts downward pressure on interest rates. Meanwhile, aging carries several fiscal challenges: Pension (and health) spending can climb when the number of retirees rises, whereas a shrinking labor force might imply lower consumption and labor income tax revenues. As a result, aging can push the public-debt-to-GDP ratio upward. The analysis considers three instruments for reform- ing pension plans. In regard to direct effects, higher social security contributions affect the disposable income of young workers, a reduction in the wage replacement rate of pensions means lower benefits for pensioners, and raising the statutory retirement age implies a reduction in the number of retirees relative to the number of workers. Policy changes employing these instruments could also trigger indirect effects through behavioral responses. The analysis considers the impact of each reform separately and when imple- mented jointly as a package, as well as with immediate implementation versus that with a 10-year delay. Each reform scenario is calibrated such that the aging- induced increase in the public-debt-to-GDP ratio is reversed in 75 years (Table 2.2.1). Simulations based on the model indicate that aging would depress per capita consumption for both the young and the old (with a larger decline in the case of the older populations) in the absence of reforms (red bars in Figure 2.2.1), because an increasing level of public debt would need to be serviced. However, the simulations also indicate that consumption losses can be attenuated and shared more equitably across generations if a reform that uses a mix of instruments\n\nWORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A C RITICAL J UNCTURE AMID P OLIC y Sh IFTS 56 International Monetary Fund | April 2025 of a general rise in the “age-friendliness” of today’s jobs (Acemoglu, Mühlbach, and Scott 2022) provides something of a silver lining. Also, occupation-level data suggest that older workers with college educations are relatively well positioned to benefit from the produc- tivity-boosting potential of AI because it complements their tasks and skills (Box 2.3). Overall, these findings suggest that healthy aging can expand the effective labor supply of older indi- viduals through higher labor force participation, employment probability, numbers of hours worked, and productivity. T o assess how healthy aging can mitigate the economic effects of population aging, the next section incorporates these elements into a general equilibrium analysis. Economic Implications of Global Population Aging The economic impact of demographic shifts is multifaceted. First, variations in fertility, mortality, and migration have an impact on both population growth rates and age structures. Given individuals’ typical life cycle—birth, schooling, working, and retirement— chronological age thresholds defining economic activity and retirement relative to life expectancy play a critical role. A rising share of the working-age population (those ages 15–64) boosts labor supply and economic growth, whereas an increasing old-age dependency ratio (number of individuals ages 65 and older relative to the number in the working-age population) weighs on growth and strains public finances on account of higher spending on pensions, health care, and long- term care. These pressures intensify as the lifespan beyond retirement age lengthens.5 Second, the expected length of working lives relative to retirement influences individuals’ saving behavior. If life expectancy increases while the effective retirement age remains unchanged, individuals tend to save more to smooth consumption over their lives, driving up aggregate savings. Moreover, if the within-economy age profiles of wealth and labor income are held fixed, an increasing share of older individuals raises total wealth. 5The subsequent analysis focuses on effective (rather than statutory) retirement age, which has significant macroeconomic implications. Among advanced economies, the median effective retirement age is about 2.5 years lower than the statutory retirement age. However, it varies widely across countries and over time, likely reflecting adjustments to the statutory retirement age, the generosity of pensions, and differences in health status among older workers. At the same time, a shrinking workforce increases capital per worker, reducing investment needs. These forces combine and, on balance, tend to place down- ward pressure on interest rates (Gagnon, Johannsen, and López-Salido 2021; April 2023 World Economic Outlook [WEO], Chapter 2). 6 The uneven pace of these trends across economies due to aging will largely shape their net foreign asset positions (Auclert and others 2024). The general equilibrium effects of aging on both growth and interest rates will have important implications for public finances. Third, beyond chronological age, physiological aging also influences individuals’ labor supply and retirement decisions. In line with findings in the previous section, research suggests that physiological functioning is a key predictor of individuals’ labor force participation and productivity, independent of their chronological age (Kotschy, Bloom, and Scott 2024). Improvements in how individuals age can thus affect education, work, and saving decisions, with broad implications for aggre- gate labor supply, interest rates, and economic growth. Finally, asynchronous aging across countries creates opportunities for efficiency gains from cross- border reallocation of production factors. Capital may flow from old, high-savings economies to younger, capital-scarce economies, shaping external balances (Gourinchas and Rey 2014; Auclert and others 2024). Similarly, labor may gradually migrate from younger, labor-abundant economies to older economies facing labor scarcity. The Model This chapter employs\n\nWORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A C RITICAL J UNCTURE AMID P OLIC y Sh IFTS 60 International Monetary Fund | April 2025 T o assess the sensitivity of projections to fertility assumptions, the model is simulated using alternative UNWPP projections based on fertility rates higher and lower than those in the medium-fertility scenario. 10 Indeed, the expected contribution from demographics to GDP growth in 2025–2100 varies widely with the fertility assumptions, with the country-specific growth estimates under alternative fertility assumptions vary- ing, for instance, by 0.5 percentage point in Australia and 1.6 percentage points in China. However, the con- tribution of demographics to GDP growth is mostly negative under different fertility assumptions. Growth Tailwinds from Labor Supply Policies How can policies mitigate the adverse economic impacts of population aging? There are three key policy levers that could provide growth tailwinds amid population aging: tackling the decline in participation rates of older individuals, extending working lives as life expectancy rises, and narrowing gender par- ticipation gaps (Figure 2.12). A set of alternative scenarios is used to assess the general equilibrium impact of addressing these issues (see details in Online Annex 2.3): Healthy-aging policies: Targeted health policies and other initiatives can enable older workers to increase their labor force participation rates. Indeed, the signif- icant increase in the global median participation rate between 2000 and 2024 in the 55–64 age group is encouraging, but there is significant room for further narrowing the participation gap with respect to prime- age workers. A first model scenario assumes the rollout of policies in areas such as health promotion and pre- vention that lead to a gradual narrowing of cross-coun- try differences in the functional capacity of workers ages 50 and older. Under such a scenario, the additional long-term improvement in the functional capacity of older individuals would reduce current cross-country gaps by one-fourth and, on average, would be equiv- alent to about 49 percent of the estimated gains over 2000–22. The results indicate notable growth dividends because of higher labor force participation rates for older individuals who have not yet reached retirement age, as well as higher productivity relative to the base- line (Figure 2.13). For the world, average annual GDP growth over 2025–2100 would be about 0.2 percentage 10Under the UNWPP’s high- (low-)fertility scenario, fertility is projected to remain 0.5 children above (below) the fertility rate in the medium-fertility scenario over most of the projection period. point higher than in the baseline—and 0.3 percentage point higher over 2025–50.11 Higher effective retirement age: There is also scope for increasing labor force participation among both men and women in the 65-and-older age group, by post- poning the effective retirement age given healthy-aging improvements. This is not necessarily or exclusively related to raising statutory retirement ages. Healthy aging may encourage older workers to voluntarily delay their retirement even if statutory retirement ages are unchanged, depending on the incentives of pension plans.12 A second scenario assumes that policy changes 11The scenario assumes all countries in the model implement policy changes, but their magnitude and pace depend on initial conditions. Countries at or close to the health frontier, which do not see any additional improvement in the functional capacity of older workers relative to the baseline, would not register growth dividends. 12At the same time, raising the statutory retirement age may not yield the desired impact on effective retirement age if older workers are not physically or cognitively able to remain active or if their produc- tivity declines rapidly with age (Kotschy, Bloom, and Scott 2024).

      "CHAPTER 3 JOURNEyS AND JUNCTIONS: SPILLO vERS FROM MIgRATION AND REFUgEE POLICIES 91International Monetary Fund | April 2025 Increased longevity and falling fertility are driving a secular rise in old-age dependency largely in advanced economies, but also in maturing emerging market economies. Advanced economies are projected to see old-age dependency rise from 20 older people for every 100 working-age individuals at the turn of the century to 50 by the end of 2050, an increase that effectively leaves one person over the age of 65 in the care of two working-age adults. The shrinking labor force is not only holding back potential growth (see the April 2024 World Economic Outlook, Chapter 3), but it is also increasing fiscal strains caused by higher health-spending needs alongside fewer workers to pay into pension systems. At the same time, many low-in- come developing countries are still in the early stages of demographic transition, experiencing a so-called youth bulge, with a high proportion of young people set to enter the workforce. However, challenges associated with high levels of informality, lack of jobs, and limited social protection are preventing the full absorption of these young people into workforces. This imbalance of labor supply, between youth-poor and youth-rich countries, can be partly alleviated by a flow of younger migrants and refugees into aging countries. Such a global resource reallocation could simultaneously ease the economic pressures from a smaller labor force in destination economies and a lack of opportunities in origin economies. However, these potential gains in a world of asynchronous aging hinge on a market-based match between the skills of young migrants and the youth-intensive comparative advan- tages of destination economies. Migration policies can support or hinder the redistribution of young workers by affecting individuals’ ability to move to countries where their skills are most needed. Migration and the Demographic Match Globally, migrants and refugees are typically younger—with a larger proportion of them of work- ing age—than natives (Figure 3.2.1). For instance, 78 percent of migrants and refugees are of working age, compared with only 63 percent of native popu- lations. Fertility rates of migrants are also higher than those of natives, providing a longer-term boost to the working-age population. Enabling age-based labor market matches through migration can yield substantial economic gains. Previous research also finds that immigrants can have The authors of this box are Paula Beltran Saavedra and Manasa Patnam. a positive net fiscal contribution over the medium term (Orrenius 2017; Clemens 2022)—that is, fiscal revenue per migrant and refugee exceeds the cost of public-goods provision, especially when adequate integration measures are in place. A double dividend can be also achieved if migration confers gains on origin economies. This, however, requires productively absorbing migrants’ excess labor and positive diaspora spillovers in knowledge transfers and human and phys- ical capital investments linked to remittances inflows, to offset a negative effect on labor supply (Carare and others 2024; Fackler, Giesing, and Laurentsyeva 2020; Leblang and Helms 2023; Williams 2024; Prato 2025). Alignment of Migration Flows with Comparative Advantage and Demographic Needs Countries vary in the youth intensity of their economic activity—the required cognitive and physical skills, which can depend on age. For instance, certain sectors require strong physical skills (such as min- ing and construction) and naturally favor younger workers. In this context, population aging can have a disproportionate impact on sectors that require young workers (Cai and Stoyanov 2016; Gu and Stoyanov 2019). Skill shortages can emerge, with Natives Migrants and refugees Figure 3.2.1. Age Distributions of Migrants and Refugees Compared with Those of\n\nWORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A C RITICAL J UNCTURE AMID P OLIC y Sh IFTS 64 International Monetary Fund | April 2025 and capital market reforms, as well as those strength- ening governance and institutions (Budina and others 2023)—are key for enabling low-income countries to reap the benefits of still-positive demographic divi- dends (Box 2.1). Gains from deeper financial integra- tion can also offset the labor losses from migration outflows toward advanced economies, in which the additional workers can boost labor supply and output amidst an aging and dwindling workforce (see Chapter 3). The simulations in this chapter suggest that a combination of policies for boosting labor supply could attenuate the slowdown in global growth over 2025–50 resulting from demographic headwinds by almost three-fourths. Although these progrowth policies could also contribute to higher global interest rates, they would nonetheless provide substantial fiscal dividends. Many countries would be able to rebuild fiscal buffers and create additional fiscal space to finance critical spending. Some economies, however, would still require additional fiscal efforts given the current precarious state of their public finances. In those cases, an early, gradual, and sustained effort is crucial to ensuring intergenerational fairness (Box 2.2) and maintaining economic stability amid ongoing demographic transitions. Although policies to boost labor supply and facil- itate cross-country factor mobility are key, they are not a substitute for efforts to reignite technological innovation and productivity growth—the ultimate driver of improvements in living standards. Structural reforms to promote market competition, financial accessibility, and labor market flexibility can boost pro- ductivity growth by fostering innovation, facilitating a more efficient allocation of capital and labor across firms (see Budina and others 2023; April 2024 WEO, Chapter 3). They can also help countries benefit from technological advances such as AI-related technologies, which are complementary to labor in occupations more typical of older workers (Box 2.3) and can pro- vide the latter with skills and methods for coping with functional decline due to aging (Abril-Jimenez and others 2022). T echnological progress and innovation can be import- ant not only for countering the adverse effects of pop- ulation aging on output growth, but also for enhancing the malleability of aging itself. Promoting research and development in the scientific understanding of biologi- cal aging has the potential to further extend healthy lon- gevity in the decades ahead (Cox 2022). Furthermore, AI-based solutions in health care hold potential for transformation through scaling up of preventive health practices (Chan and others 2024), for instance by auto- mating routine tasks such as screening and diagnostics. They can also bring clinical expertise to underserved and remote areas, helping to reduce the heterogeneity in physical and cognitive capabilities of older individuals documented in this chapter. For example, the Aravind Eye Care System in India has deployed AI-based tools to screen millions of retinal images for diabetic retinopathy, effectively addressing the country’s shortage of ophthal- mologists and preventing vision loss among patients (Yu, Beam, and Kohane 2018). Ultimately, the rise of the silver economy brings both challenges and opportunities, making a compre- hensive and proactive policy approach essential for navigating the challenges of population aging while harnessing the benefits of longer, healthier lives.\n\nCHAPTER 2 ThE RISE OF ThE SIL vER ECONOMy: GLObAL IMPLICATIONS OF POPULATION A GING 63International Monetary Fund | April 2025 sizable disparities across socioeconomic groups and countries. Importantly, this healthier-aging trend has also been associated with higher labor force participa- tion rates, a higher likelihood of being employed, and higher labor earnings for individuals ages 50 and older. Nevertheless, population aging, together with other forces such as waning catch-up growth in large emerging market economies, is expected to depress global economic growth. Even as ongoing gains from healthy aging are estimated to boost annual global growth by about 0.4 percentage point over 2025–50, the analysis in this chapter indicates that under current policies global output growth would decline on average by about 2 percentage points through the end of the century. With lower growth prospects and historically high levels of public debt, many countries will need significant fiscal efforts to keep debt-to-GDP ratios stable beyond 2030. A multifaceted policy approach is essential to deal with these challenges. Broad-based improvement in the functional capacity of individuals ages 50 and older over the past few decades shows that aging can be a malleable process (Scott 2023). Policies aimed at improving the human capital of older workers can enhance productivity and narrow the participation gap with prime-age workers. Emphasizing health promotion and prevention policies is warranted, and these policies need to be carefully deployed to address health inequalities. Measures that tackle behavioral risk factors throughout the course of life—such as tobacco smoking, harmful alcohol use, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diets—and other risk factors related to the environment and mental health can decrease the incidence of chronic diseases and health inequalities (Liu and others 2016; Rashbrook 2019; Lee, Park, and Lee 2020; Hacker 2024). Examples include immuni- zation, regular health checks, screenings for chronic diseases, campaigns to prevent substance abuse, tax- ation (for example, on tobacco and unhealthy food), regulations (for example, those to promote smoke-free environments), and providing access to mental health resources. These measures often span beyond the health care sector and are not necessarily costly. Evi- dence suggests many are cost-effective and can produce savings by reducing expenditure on health intervention down the road (McDaid, Sassi, and Merkur 2015; OECD 2015). Yet spending on health promotion and prevention accounts for only 1–6 percent of total health expenditure in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Devel- opment and tends to be cut disproportionately during downturns (Gmeinder, Morgan, and Mueller 2017; Hacker 2024). A comprehensive approach, combining pension reforms, training, and workplace adaptations, should complement health-oriented interventions to increase effective retirement ages in line with improvements in life expectancy. Besides changes to statutory retirement ages, reducing early retirement benefits, introducing incentives to postpone retirement, and allowing for phased retirement can induce a rise in effective retire- ment age. Pension system reforms need to balance sustainability with adequate protection to mitigate old-age poverty and inequality (Amaglobeli and others 2019). More broadly, the malleability of aging and the diversity in health status and experience among older workers suggest that age-based provisions in policies are likely to be inefficient and should be reconsidered (see discussion in Scott 2023). Also, lifelong upskilling and reskilling programs are crucial to ensure individ- uals remain employable as they age. This becomes even more important at the cusp of a potential AI revolution, in which skilled older workers will be well positioned to reap the benefits given the complemen- tarity of their skills with AI, whereas unskilled workers may struggle to keep their jobs or manage successful job transitions (Box 2.3). Enhancing adaptability through flexible work arrangements and workplace adjustments that improve the\n\nCHAPTER 2 ThE RISE OF ThE SIL vER ECONOMy: GLObAL IMPLICATIONS OF POPULATION A GING 51International Monetary Fund | April 2025 of older individuals with higher accumulated savings in large economies, is projected to exert downward pressure on interest rates. Still, most countries are likely to face a worse interest-growth differential than in the recent past, and many will need higher primary balances than they registered in 2016–18 to keep debt ratios stable from 2030 onward. Uneven demographic trends are also likely to exert widening pressure on external global posi- tions through the end of the century. • A multifaceted policy approach can increase labor supply, boost growth, and ease fiscal pressures amid global population aging. Lifelong policies to support the human capital of workers in late adulthood (that is, people who are between age 50 and retirement age), including health promotion and prevention measures, can significantly counter the effect of population aging on growth. In addition, raising labor force participation among the 65-and-older age group—by gradually increasing the effective retirement age in line with improvements in life expectancy—and closing gender gaps where they remain large would provide significant growth tailwinds in many countries. A combination of labor supply policies could boost global annual output growth by about 0.6 percentage point over the next 25 years, offsetting almost three-fourths of the drag from demographics during that period. The fiscal dividends from progrowth policies would enable many countries to rebuild buffers and create space for critical spending needs. Expanding access to international financial markets through credit and capital market reforms, alongside stronger gover- nance and institutions, would allow younger, low-in- come countries to reap demographic dividends before the window for doing so closes and offset potential losses from migration outflows to older, labor-scarce economies. The chapter examines the implications of popula- tion aging for growth, interest rates, external balances, and public finances but does not cover all relevant aspects. Notably, it abstracts from shifts in consumer demand and sectoral reallocations driven by aging, as well as the implications for the financial sector, house prices, and urbanization. The analysis also abstracts from endogenous technological responses to aging— such as automation and artificial intelligence (AI)— which could mitigate some of the negative growth effects. Uneven Pace of Global Population Aging Advancements in health care, public health mea- sures, and improvements in living standards in past decades have contributed to significant declines in mortality rates across the world. Lower mortality rates in middle and old age have resulted in significant increases in life expectancy and longevity. These trends, together with falling birth rates, are leading to signifi- cant changes in the age structure of economies. Under current demographic projections, econo- mies around the world are progressively crossing their “demographic turning point”—the year when the share of the working-age population in their total popula- tion begins to decline—typically marking a transition from a demographic dividend to a demographic drag (Bloom, Canning, and Sevilla 2003). By 2035, all advanced economies and the largest emerging markets will have crossed this threshold (Figure 2.2, panel 1). By 2070, most low-income countries will have experi- enced similar shifts. At the same time, increased longevity is contrib- uting to the rise of the silver economy, because the share of the older population is projected to increase rapidly (Figure 2.2, panel 2). Although the rise in the share of older individuals is steepest in the “early agers”—including the largest advanced economies and emerging markets in Europe and Asia—the relatively younger Latin American economies, as well as the world’s youngest regions (Africa and the Middle East), will also experience a sharp rise in the share of the older population. Aging is no longer a concern limited to advanced economies; it is a universal trend whose implications all countries will navigate throughout this\n\n2.2, panel 2).

And the window for low-income countries to reap demo- graphic dividends is gradually closing. Healthy Aging and Implications for Labor Markets Because longevity is a key driver of changes in the age structure of economies, an important question is whether individuals are aging in better health. Is there evidence that the functional ability of older individuals has been increasing over time? How broad-based are these gains across different economies? And what are the implications for labor markets? T o tackle these questions, this section uses micro- data from surveys of individuals ages 50 and above,"

    "answer": "Immigration can help offset the challenges of an aging population in rich countries by providing a flow of younger migrants and refugees into aging countries. This global resource reallocation can ease economic pressures from a smaller labor force in destination economies and address the lack of opportunities in origin economies. Migrants and refugees are typically younger and have a larger proportion of working-age individuals compared to natives, which can help alleviate skill shortages in sectors that require young workers. Additionally, enabling age-based labor market matches through migration can yield substantial economic gains, as immigrants can have a positive net fiscal contribution over the medium term, especially when adequate integration measures are in place.",

Their higher fertility rates also provide a longer-term demographic boost, especially when integration policies support effective labor market matching."

Several important features drive the modeling results. Individuals choose whether and where to migrate and which pathway to use, given policy and nonpolicy migration costs, as well as the real wages they can earn in different destinations, which reflect factors such as the complementarity of their skills with those of residents. The economic impact of policy- induced changes in flows depends largely on two opposing forces: (1) agglomeration, wherein a net inflow of migrants can lead to higher total factor productivity from, for example, knowledge spillovers and increased entrepreneurship; and (2) congestion, which stems from increasing strain on local services, businesses’ equip- ment and properties, and publicly provided infrastruc- ture, such that an increase in population lowers capital per worker in the short to medium term (Saiz 2007; Melo, Graham, and Noland 2009; Kline and Moretti 2013; Colas and Sachs 2024). Over the long term, economies that successfully build capital can reap the benefits of net migration flows, increasing potential output per capita. Distributional Implications of Targeted Migration Policies In the first exercise, tighter policies in a destination economy that target migrants from certain origin economies are assumed to reduce the stock of migrants from these economies by 20 percent over the short to medium term relative to the baseline. 16 As a result, 0.25 percent more of the native population remains in the origin economies (origin suppression). At the same time, flows—of both low- and high-skilled refugees— through the refugee pathway increase (categorical substi- tution). Relative to the baseline, low-skilled refugee flows increase by 4 percent, and high-skilled refugee flows increase by 0.5 percent (Figure 3.10, panel 1). 16These flows tend to be small as a share of the overall population in the destination economy. In this exercise, migrants account for 0.3 percent of the population from the origin countries and roughly half of that amount when measured in percent of the population in the destination economy. The 20 percent reduction in economic migration is broadly comparable to the predicted outflows following a one-standard-deviation increase in labor migration indices from the Immigration Policies in Comparison (IMPIC) database—which capture migration tightening of policies targeted at migrants. The exercise also finds significant deflection of migrants toward bordering destination economies (destination substitution). The increase in flows to these alternative destinations from the targeted origin economies is broad-based across migrants and refugees, although larger in the case of low-skilled refugees, which increase by 2 percent (Figure 3.10, panel 2). The increased inflows of low-skilled refugees reflect relatively lower barriers for this pathway compared with the base- line, and the prospect of higher incomes for low-skilled workers. The results also indicate that the implement- ing jurisdiction receives larger flows of low-skilled migrants and refugees from economies bordering those to which the tighter migration policies were targeted (origin substitution). By contrast, a higher share of high- skilled workers from these bordering economies refrain from emigrating altogether to take advantage of the productivity gains from skill complementarities with the deflected low-skilled workers and agglomeration.

Advanced economies are projected to see old-age dependency rise from 20 older people for every 100 working-age individuals at the turn of the century to 50 by the end of 2050, an increase that effectively leaves one person over the age of 65 in the care of two working-age adults. The shrinking labor force is not only holding back potential growth (see the April 2024 World Economic Outlook, Chapter 3), but it is also increasing fiscal strains caused by higher health-spending needs alongside fewer workers to pay into pension systems. At the same time, many low-in- come developing countries are still in the early stages of demographic transition, experiencing a so-called youth bulge, with a high proportion of young people set to enter the workforce. However, challenges associated with high levels of informality, lack of jobs, and limited social protection are preventing the full absorption of these young people into workforces. This imbalance of labor supply, between youth-poor and youth-rich countries, can be partly alleviated by a flow of younger migrants and refugees into aging countries. Such a global resource reallocation could simultaneously ease the economic pressures from a smaller labor force in destination economies and a lack of opportunities in origin economies. However, these potential gains in a world of asynchronous aging hinge on a market-based match between the skills of young migrants and the youth-intensive comparative advan- tages of destination economies. Migration policies can support or hinder the redistribution of young workers by affecting individuals’ ability to move to countries where their skills are most needed. Migration and the Demographic Match Globally, migrants and refugees are typically younger—with a larger proportion of them of work- ing age—than natives (Figure 3.2.1). For instance, 78 percent of migrants and refugees are of working age, compared with only 63 percent of native popu- lations. Fertility rates of migrants are also higher than those of natives, providing a longer-term boost to the working-age population. Enabling age-based labor market matches through migration can yield substantial economic gains. Previous research also finds that immigrants can have The authors of this box are Paula Beltran Saavedra and Manasa Patnam. a positive net fiscal contribution over the medium term (Orrenius 2017; Clemens 2022)—that is, fiscal revenue per migrant and refugee exceeds the cost of public-goods provision, especially when adequate integration measures are in place. A double dividend can be also achieved if migration confers gains on origin economies. This, however, requires productively absorbing migrants’ excess labor and positive diaspora spillovers in knowledge transfers and human and phys- ical capital investments linked to remittances inflows, to offset a negative effect on labor supply (Carare and others 2024; Fackler, Giesing, and Laurentsyeva 2020; Leblang and Helms 2023; Williams 2024; Prato 2025). Alignment of Migration Flows with Comparative Advantage and Demographic Needs Countries vary in the youth intensity of their economic activity—the required cognitive and physical skills, which can depend on age. For instance, certain sectors require strong physical skills (such as min- ing and construction) and naturally favor younger workers. In this context, population aging can have a disproportionate impact on sectors that require young workers (Cai and Stoyanov 2016; Gu and Stoyanov 2019). Skill shortages can emerge, with Natives Migrants and refugees Figure 3.2.1. Age Distributions of Migrants and Refugees Compared with Those of\n\nWORLD ECONOMIC OUTLOOK: A C RITICAL J UNCTURE AMID P OLIC y Sh IFTS 94 International Monetary Fund | April 2025 some countries (see the October 2016 World Economic Outlook, Chapter 4). At the same time, overcoming constraints on the full economic participation of refugees could lower costs of assistance in low- and middle-income countries by about 75 percent (World Bank and UNHCR 2024). The capacity to adapt to migrants and refugees and fully integrate them into the workforce is also important in determining how quickly economies may benefit from higher labor income tax revenues and increasing returns to capital. Where impediments to business investment (and to capital accumulation) exist, the full benefits from an increase in the supply of labor may be delayed (Caliendo and others 2023). Furthermore, where integration challenges exist, congestion effects including increased demand for public services and infrastructure—for instance, access to health care and housing—may (at least temporarily) place strains on public finances. Across generations, immigration may provide more pronounced benefits as first-generation immigrants better integrate into destination economies, capital adjusts, and subsequent generations contribute to labor force growth, economic activity, productivity, and higher tax revenues (Sultanov 2021). 1 Sustained economic growth from enhanced productivity, combined with larger revenue streams, can improve fiscal outcomes and, ultimately, the sustainability of public finances. At the same time, descendants of immigrants generally tend to have more favorable net fiscal impacts, reflecting slightly higher educational achievements and higher wages and salaries (Blau and Mackie 2017). 1Indeed, projections by the US Congressional Budget Office estimate that a multiyear wave of 6 million immigrants would reduce the US federal deficit by $0.9 trillion by 2034 (US CBO 2024). The UK Office for Budget Responsibility has projected that an increase in annual net migration from 129,000 to 245,000 arrivals would reduce public debt as a share of GDP by 30 percentage points (UK OBR 2023).

      "International Monetary Fund | April 2025 75 Emerging market and developing economies have found themselves increasingly on the receiving end of migrant and refugee flows, hosting the lion’s share of the latter. This chapter examines how an economy’s policies to manage legal inflows of migrants and refugees can have important spillovers to other destination and transit economies, as well as the economies from which these flows originate. Tighter policies in other jurisdictions can increase inflows to a given economy by 10 percent over five years. Fur- thermore, output in an average economy receiving these additional inflows can increase by 0.2 percent over the same horizon. The overall effect on output can often be modest, as inflows can strain local resources and refugees tend to be less well matched with skills needs in local labor markets. However, output effects can be larger should the skills of migrants and refugees complement those of natives. The policy emphasis is on improving the integration of migrants and refugees and minimizing skills mismatches. In emerging market and developing economies, the returns from better integrating refugees can be particularly large. Furthermore, measures are needed to alleviate pressures on local services and infrastructure, by prioritizing productive public investment and pro- moting private sector development. International policy cooperation can help distribute the short-term costs of hosting large and unexpected inflows more evenly across economies and improve outcomes over the long term. Introduction The legal movement of migrants and refu- gees has become an increasingly familiar fixture of public debate. Flows, as a share of the global population, steadily increased from the late 1990s The authors of this chapter are Paula Beltran Saavedra, Nicolas Fernandez-Arias, Shushanik Hakobyan, Samuel Mann, Neil Meads, and Carolina Osorio Buitron, under the guidance of Aqib Aslam, and with support from Shan Chen, Camara Kidd, Xiaomeng Mei, and Johannes Rosenbusch. It includes contributions from Desire Kanga, Roland Kpodar, Manasa Patnam, and Annalaura Sacco. Lorenzo Caliendo, Fernando Parro, and Timo T onassi were external consultants. The authors thank Michael Clemens for his invaluable comments. until the global financial crisis, broadly in line with familiar globalization trends for goods and capital (Figure 3.1). As of 2024, the global stock of legal migrants and refugees had reached 304 million—or 3.7 percent of the global population—almost double that observed in 1995, with about one in six being refugees or asylum seekers. Furthermore, about 40 percent of migrants and 75 percent of refugees now reside in emerging market and developing economies. These patterns are the result of “pull” and “push” factors—including geopolitical shocks and natural disasters, which have increased in frequency—and the configuration of migration and refugee policies. Policies in destination economies, in particular, are likely to have played an important role by altering frictions—and therefore the costs and benefits— associated with individual migration decisions. Just as policies have helped shape the level and com- position of observed legal flows, so too have changes in the acceptance of migrants and refugees, which has been deteriorating in several major destination economies (Figure 3.2, panel 1). Increased media cov- erage of migration has further driven policy discourse (Figure 3.2, panel 2). Survey responses suggest that migration-related pressures are also unlikely to abate, because the intention to migrate remains robust despite the inability of all potential migrants to reach their preferred destination (Figure 3.2, panel 3). Migrants from emerging market and developing economies often aspire to move to advanced economies—either within or outside their region—but they are more likely to end up in other nearby economies within the same income group.

Furthermore, esti- mates suggest that a tightening of refugee policies by a set of destinations—designed to reduce refugee inflows into those economies by 60 percent over one year—is associated with an increase in refugee inflows into other economies of close to 8 percent within one year (Figure 3.9, panel 2). Deflected refugee inflows result- ing from stricter refugee policies elsewhere—capturing destination substitution effects—do not generate meaningful output gains on average, given absorption challenges. However, estimates using indicators with a better coverage of integration policies—such as naturalization and greater ease of movement within a country—indicate that output effects are much larger for emerging market and developing destination econ- omies where integration policies are stronger (Online Annex 3.3). Beyond aggregate output effects, shifts in migration flows can have broad-ranging macroeconomic impacts on destination economies. For instance, empirical studies find positive impacts of immigration on productivity—often attributed to complementarities between native and immigrant workers (Peri 2011; Ortega and Peri 2014; Alesina, Harnoss, and Rapoport 2015; Jaumotte, Koloskova, and Saxena 2016). Such complementarities are also cited by the literature for limited evidence that migration affects the wages or employment of native workers (Kerr and Kerr 2011; Peri 2014). High-skilled immigration, in particu- lar, is associated with better economic outcomes, including higher wages for natives and enhanced firm performance. The results from the gravity model suggest that there are spillovers from changes in migration and refugee policies. However, care is required to inter- pret them: Migration and refugee flows may influ- ence policies rather than the other way around, and measurement error may exist, resulting from, among other factors, lack of comprehensive data on bilateral migration policies.14 Nonetheless, questions remain regarding the macroeconomic implications of policy spillovers for the global economy and their welfare impacts given the existence of multiple spillover chan- nels, alternative legal pathways for immigration, and various integration frictions. Modeling Spillovers from Migration and Refugee Policy Changes In this section, a spatial dynamic general equilib- rium model of trade and migration is used to conduct two exercises that evaluate (1) the distributional impli- cations of targeted migration and refugee policy tight- ening and the associated costs and benefits to different economies over varying time horizons; and (2) whether international coordination can generate better out- comes than unilateral policy changes, by trading off potential short-term costs of immigration for long- term benefits (Caliendo and others 2021, 2023). 15 In addition to modeling changes in the overall flow of migrants and refugees between economies—allowing for both deflection and deterrence—the model’s frame- work distinguishes between the different legal pathways 14Relatedly, a gravity framework based on an aggregate assessment of an economy’s migration policies may underestimate the magnitude of spillovers, given that adjustments to migration policies often target flows from specific countries of origin or correlate with policy changes in other destination economies. 15In the first exercise, the targeted migration policies apply to both new and incumbent migrants, that is, they alter both barriers to enter and those to remain. Both exercises use a historical episode as a baseline. 1.

Over the long term, economies that successfully build capital can reap the benefits of net migration flows, increasing potential output per capita.

Tighter policies in other jurisdictions can increase inflows to a given economy by 10 percent over five years. Fur- thermore, output in an average economy receiving these additional inflows can increase by 0.2 percent over the same horizon. The overall effect on output can often be modest, as inflows can strain local resources and refugees tend to be less well matched with skills needs in local labor markets. However, output effects can be larger should the skills of migrants and refugees complement those of natives. The policy emphasis is on improving the integration of migrants and refugees and minimizing skills mismatches. In emerging market and developing economies, the returns from better integrating refugees can be particularly large. Furthermore, measures are needed to alleviate pressures on local services and infrastructure, by prioritizing productive public investment and pro- moting private sector development. International policy cooperation can help distribute the short-term costs of hosting large and unexpected inflows more evenly across economies and improve outcomes over the long term. Introduction The legal movement of migrants and refu- gees has become an increasingly familiar fixture of public debate. Flows, as a share of the global population, steadily increased from the late 1990s The authors of this chapter are Paula Beltran Saavedra, Nicolas Fernandez-Arias, Shushanik Hakobyan, Samuel Mann, Neil Meads, and Carolina Osorio Buitron, under the guidance of Aqib Aslam, and with support from Shan Chen, Camara Kidd, Xiaomeng Mei, and Johannes Rosenbusch.

The authors thank Michael Clemens for his invaluable comments. until the global financial crisis, broadly in line with familiar globalization trends for goods and capital (Figure 3.1). As of 2024, the global stock of legal migrants and refugees had reached 304 million—or 3.7 percent of the global population—almost double that observed in 1995, with about one in six being refugees or asylum seekers. Furthermore, about 40 percent of migrants and 75 percent of refugees now reside in emerging market and developing economies. These patterns are the result of “pull” and “push” factors—including geopolitical shocks and natural disasters, which have increased in frequency—and the configuration of migration and refugee policies. Policies in destination economies, in particular, are likely to have played an important role by altering frictions—and therefore the costs and benefits— associated with individual migration decisions. Just as policies have helped shape the level and com- position of observed legal flows, so too have changes in the acceptance of migrants and refugees, which has been deteriorating in several major destination economies (Figure 3.2, panel 1). Increased media cov- erage of migration has further driven policy discourse (Figure 3.2, panel 2). Survey responses suggest that migration-related pressures are also unlikely to abate, because the intention to migrate remains robust despite the inability of all potential migrants to reach their preferred destination (Figure 3.2, panel 3). Migrants from emerging market and developing economies often aspire to move to advanced economies—either within or outside their region—but they are more likely to end up in other nearby economies within the same income group. This chapter examines spillovers from changes in migration and refugee policies in destination econ- omies to other jurisdictions, unlike previous work, which focuses on the impact of flows on origin and\n\nCHAPTER 3 JOURNEyS AND JUNCTIONS: SPILLO vERS FROM MIgRATION AND REFUgEE POLICIES 79International Monetary Fund | April 2025 to be more responsive to changes in labor market conditions arising from both cyclical factors and structural changes—such as demographic and sec- toral shifts.5 • Migrants and refugees—who tend to have signifi- cantly lower age profiles than the native population (April 2020 World Economic Outlook [WEO], Chap- ter 4; Box 3.2)—can generate economic gains that outweigh fiscal costs and even ease fiscal pressures if they are well integrated into the labor force (Clem- ens 2024; Box 3.3; see also the April 2025 WEO, Chapter 2). • Furthermore, migrants and refugees may help con- tain (wage push) inflationary pressures by increas- ing the labor supply, as observed across multiple sectors in advanced economies since the pandemic (Cheremukhin and others 2024). These effects can be more pronounced where native workers have skill levels similar to those of migrants and refugees. 5There is evidence that immigrants are more responsive to labor shortages than natives, which reflects, in part, the fact that they have already incurred labor mobility costs. See Online Annex 3.2 for more details. However, migrants can also contribute to infla- tionary pressures by raising demand (Manacorda, Manning, and Wadsworth 2012; April 2020 WEO, Chapter 4; Box 3.4). • Overall, migration policy frameworks will determine how job vacancies are filled between natives and migrants—the latter tend to mobilize in sectors in which labor demand is high, jobs are hard to fill, and barriers to entry are lower (Figure 3.5; Online Annex 3.2). Meanwhile, refugees frequently struggle to join the labor force or find employment opportunities that fully utilize their skills. The benefits from their contri- butions are larger, notably in the long term, if they are well integrated into the labor market. Evidence indi- cates that the complementarity of migrants and refugee skills with those of natives and the strength of inte- gration policies matter also for emerging market and developing economies (Viseth 2021). However, even in situations in which refugees have a common language and culture, legal and structural barriers mean that they tend to work in the informal sector (Alvarez and others 2022). These findings also suggest that there EMDE-MECA EMDE-LAC AE-Europe EMDE-Asia EMDE-Europe AE-CAN/US AE-Asia EMDE-SSA Origin region AE-Europe EMDE-MECA AE-CAN/US EMDE-LAC EMDE-Europe EMDE-Asia EMDE-SSA AE-Asia Destination region Figure 3.4.

Shifts in migration and refugee policies in destination economies can result in spillovers by altering flows of legal migrants and refugees in the global economy. Although these policy changes cannot substitute for actions to sustainably address underlying pull and push factors, particularly those relating to forced displacement, they can help manage flows to these economies’ benefit. Improving behind-the-border migration and refugee policies on integration, together with infrastructure investment and active labor market policies, can help ease short- term congestion costs. International cooperation can also help redistribute these costs. Migration and Refugee Patterns and Policies Advanced economies continue to host some of the largest groups of migrants, mostly pulled from emerging market and developing economies. 3 Flows to advanced economies accounted for the bulk of global movements in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Since then, flows of both migrants and refugees between emerging market and developing economies have increased and now account for almost half of overall net flows, with three of the five largest increases in migrant and refugee stocks during 2010–24 having taken place in large emerging market economies (Figure 3.3). During 2020–24, most gross flows were also between economies within the same region and income group, highlighting the fact that migration and refugee journeys are frequently undertaken only over short distances (Figure 3.4). Recent developments also reflect a significant increase in flows of refugees who have been forcibly displaced or pushed from their homes by political instability, conflict, violence, persecutions, human rights violations, and natural disasters. About two- thirds of the stock of refugees are hosted in neigh- boring countries, with four out of the top five hosts being emerging market and developing economies (Box 3.1).4 The global distribution of refugees can 3These pull factors involved can include higher standards of living—including higher incomes, better health outcomes, stronger educational systems and institutions, and a safer environment—as well as linguistic, or cultural proximity, or family ties. 4Political instability, conflict, and natural disasters can contribute to push individuals from their homes and are key factors behind the increase in migrant and refugee flows between emerging market and developing economies. Deteriorating social and economic conditions and a lack of opportunities in origin economies are other examples of push factors. place a disproportionate burden on emerging market and developing economies, which are often not as well equipped as advanced economies to absorb the large inflows involved. Economic implications will vary according to the characteristics of migrant and refugee inflows. In general, migration has been found to be beneficial for advanced economies. • Migrants are generally more mobile geographically and occupationally than natives, allowing them Change in refugee stock Change in migrant stock Share in destination economy population in 2010 (percent, right scale) EMDE-EMDE refugee EMDE-AE refugee AE-AE migrant AE-EMDE refugee EMDE-EMDE migrant EMDE-AE migrant AE-EMDE migrant All /f_lows (percent of global population, right scale) Figure 3.3.

This box provides an overview of some of the main channels and mecha- nisms at play. The fiscal impact of immigration will be influ- enced by the characteristics of a particular destination economy, the migration pathway used, migrants’ age profile, the degree of complementarity of their skills with those of natives, and investment needs to ease public services congestion. In advanced economies, evidence exists that migrants and refugees have on average a more favor- able net fiscal impact than that of natives (Sallam and Christl 2024; UK OBR 2024). Such findings are linked to typical age profiles—with working-age immigrants providing a more positive fiscal boost to destination economies than those outside of work- ing age (de Matos 2021) and evidence that a higher proportion of migrants are of working age than in the native population (Box 3.2). Similarly, the fiscal contributions of some economic migrants are on average greater than those of other immigrants (van de Beek and others 2024). Likewise, migrants who are highly educated (or more highly paid) and relatively young can place substantial downward pressure on budget deficits over their lifetimes, whereas migrants with fewer qualifications (or who are relatively lower paid) and older may induce net fiscal costs (Di Martino 2024; UK OBR 2024; Figure 3.3.1). Taken together, this implies that positive contributions of some migrants may be partly offset by negative contributions of others (Rowthorn 2008). But once capital taxes paid by employers of immigrant labor are taken into consideration, the benefits of working-age immigrants for fiscal outturns may be positive, even those for immigrants who do not have a high school education (Clemens 2022). Furthermore, if migrants do not make claims on government expenditure in old age, then net lifetime benefits to their destination economies may be enhanced (Rowthorn 2008). Investment and labor market integration chal- lenges may be more pertinent for some emerging market and developing economies because of broader The author of this box is Samuel Mann. institutional-capacity constraints. Furthermore, these economies are often the largest recipients of refugee flows, which—if they are large and unexpected— can result in more acute integration challenges and skills mismatches (Evans and Fitzgerald 2017; Brell, Dustmann, and Preston 2020). Indeed, even in regard to advanced economies there is evidence that refu- gees have lower labor force participation rates than migrants (Figure 3.3.2). Cultural, legal, and structural barriers can also drive refugees into informal employ- ment with relatively lower fiscal benefits than those in the formal sector. The combined result of such challenges is to constrain the potential fiscal benefits from hosting migrants and refugees—indeed, the short-term fiscal costs of hosting refugees are sizable in Representative UK native Average-wage migrant in UK Low-wage migrant in UK High-wage migrant in UK Intra-EU migrants in EU (right scale) Representative EU native (right scale) Figure 3.3.1.

      "NOTES TO THE FY 2024 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 142 Note 25. Social Insurance SOSI presents the projected actuarial PV of the estimated future revenue and estimated future expenditures of the Social Security, Medicare, Railroad Retirement, and Black Lung social insurance programs which are administered by the SSA, HHS, RRB, and DOL, respectively. Social Security and Medicare projections are based on current law and the Social Security and Medicare trustees intermediate set of assumptions, except that the projections assume full Social Security and Medicare Part A benefits are paid after fund depletion contrary to current law. See Note 29 —Subsequent Events for additional information on the Social Security Fairness Act. Contributions consist of: payroll, income, and excise taxes, premiums from, and state transfers on behalf of, participants in Medicare, and miscellaneous reimbursements from the General Fund. Generally, beneficiaries finance the remainder of Parts B and D costs via monthly premiums to these programs. With the introduction of Part D drug coverage, Medicaid is no longer the primary payer of drug costs for full -benefit dually eligible beneficiaries of Medicare and Medicaid. For those beneficiaries, states are subject to a contribution requirement and must pay a portion of their estimated foregone drug costs into the Part D account (referred to as state transfers). By accounting convention, the General Fund transfers are eliminated in the consolidation of the SOSI at the government -wide level. These General Fund transfers that are used to finance Medicare Parts B and D are also shown as eliminations on these calculations. For the FYs 2024 and 202 3, the amounts eliminated totaled $50.2 trillion and $48.5 trillion, respectively. The SOSI also includes projected general revenues that, under current law, would be used to finance the remainder of the expenditures in excess of revenues for Medicare Parts B and D that is reported in the SOSI. Expenditures include benefit payments scheduled under current law and administrative expenses. Once the reserves in the trust funds are depleted, under current law benefits for Social Security and Medicare Part A can be paid only to the extent there are resources from dedicated income sources. Social insurance programs utilize “trust funds” to account for dedicated collections held for later use to accomplish the program’s purpose. Expenditures reflect full benefit payments even after the point at which trust fund asset reserves are projected to be depleted. Refer to the unaudited RSI–Social Insurance section and SSA’s, HHS’s, RRB’s, and DOL’s financial statements for additional information on Social Security, Medicare, Railroad Retirement, and Black Lung program financing. The estimates in the consolidated SOSI of the open group measures are for persons who are participants or eventually will participate in the programs as contributors (workers) or beneficiaries (retired workers, survivors, dependents, and disabled) during the 75 -year projection period. The closed group comprises only current participants which are those who have attained age 15 at the start of the projection period. Actuarial PV of estimated future income (excluding interest) and estimated future expenditures for the Social Security and Medicare social insurance programs are presented for three differen t groups of participants: 1) current participants who have not yet attained eligibility age; 2) current participants who have attained eligibility age; and 3) new entrants, who are expected to become participants in the future. Current participants in the Social Security and Medicare programs are the closed group of taxpayers and/or beneficiaries who are aged at least 15 years at the start of the projection period. Future participants for Social Security and Medicare include those born during the projection period and individuals below age 15 as of January 1 of the valuation year. Railroad Retirement’s future participants are the projected new entrants as of October 1 of the valuation year. The trust fund balances as of the valuation date for the respective programs, including interest earned, are shown in the table below. 20 The PV of estimated future expenditures in\n\n171 FY 2024 REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) Social Insurance The social insurance programs consisting of Social Security, Medicare, Railroad Retirement, Black Lung, and UI were developed to provide income security and health care coverage to citizens under specific circumstances as a responsibility of the government. Because taxpayers rely on these programs in their long -term planning, social insurance program information should indicate whether the current statutory provisions of the programs can be sustained, and more generally what effect these provisions likely have on the government’s financial condition. The resources needed to run these programs are raised through taxes and fees. Eligibility for benefits depends in part on earnings and time worked by the individuals. Social Security benefits are generally redistributed intentionally toward lower -wage workers (i.e., benefits are progressive). In addition, each social insurance program has a uniform set of eligibility events and schedules that apply to all participants. RSI material is generally drawn from the 2024 Annual Reports of the Boards of Trustees, which represents the official government evaluation of the financial and actuarial status of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds. Unless otherwise noted, all data are for calendar years, all projections are based on current law and the Trustees intermediate set of assumptions. A significant exception is that the projections disregard benefit payment reductions that would result from the projected depletion of the OASDI and HI Trust Funds. Under current law, benefit payments would be reduced to levels that could be covered by incoming tax and premium revenues when the trust fund balances have been depleted. Social Security and Medicare Social Security The OASI and DI Trust Funds were established on January 1, 1940 and August 1, 1956, respectively as separate accounts in Treasury. The OASI fund pays cash retirement benefits to eligible retirees and their eligible dependents and survivors, and the much smaller DI fund pays cash benefits to eligible individuals who are unable to work because of medical conditions and certain family members of such eligible individuals. All financial operations of the OASI and DI Programs are handled through these respective funds. The two funds are often referred to as the combined OASDI Trust Funds or “Social Security.” At the end of calendar year 2023, Social Security benefits were paid to approximately 67 million beneficiaries. The events that trigger benefit payments are quite different however, both trust funds have the same dedicated financing structure: taxes paid by workers, their employers, and individuals with self -employment income, based on work covered by the Social Security Program. Currently, employers and employees each pay 6.2 percent of taxable earnings, and the self - employed pay 12.4 percent of taxable earnings. Payroll taxes are levied on wages and net earnings from self -employment up to a specified maximum annual amount, referred to as maximum taxable earnings ($168,600.00 in 2024), that increases each year with economy-wide average wages. Legislation passed in 1984 subjected up to half of Social Security benefits to income tax and allocated the revenue to the OASDI Trust Funds. In 1993 legislation increased the potentially taxed portion of benefits to 85.0 percent and allocated the additional revenue to the Medicare’s HI Trust Fund. Medicare The Medicare Program, created in 1965, has two separate trust funds: the HI Trust Fund (otherwise known as Medicare Part A) and the SMI Trust Funds (which consists of the Medicare Part B and Part D 9 accounts). HI helps pay for inpatient hospital skilled nursing facility, home health, and hospice. SMI helps pay for hospital outpatient services, physician servic es, and assorted other services and products through Part B and for prescription drugs through Part D. Though the events that trigger benefit payments are similar, HI and SMI have different dedicated financing structures. Similar to Social Security, HI is financed primarily by payroll contributions. Currently, employers and employees each pay 1.45 percent of earnings, while self -employed workers pay 2.9 percent of their net earnings. SMI is\n\nAmounts reported in t he SOSI and in the RSI section in this Financial Report are based on each program’s official actuarial calculations. This year’s projections for Social Security and Medicare are based on the same economic and demographic assumptions that underlie the 2024 Social Security and Medicare Trustees Reports and the 2024 SOSI, while comparative information presented from last year’s report is based on the 2023 Social Security and Medicare Trustees Reports and the 2023 SOSI. Table 7 summarizes amounts reported in the SOSI, showing that net social insurance expenditures are projected to be $78.3 trillion over 75 years as of January 1, 2024 for the open group, remaining largely unchanged, decreasing by approximately $100.0 billion compared to net expenditures of $78.4 trillion projected in the FY 2023 Financial Report . 25 24 The Black Lung Benefits Act provides for monthly payments and medical benefits to coal miners totally disabled from pneumoconiosis (black lung disease) arising from their employment in or around the nation's coal mines. See RRB’s projections are based on economic and demographic assumptions that underlie the 29th Actuarial Valuation of the Assets and Liabilities Under the Railroad Retirement Acts as of December 31, 20 22 with Technical Supplement, which also serves as the Annual Report for 2024 , and the 2023 Annual Report on the Railroad Retirement System required by Section 502 of the Railroad Retirement Solvency Act of 1983 (P.L. 98-76). 25 Closed group and open group differ by the population included in each calculation. From the SOSI, the closed group includes: 1) participants who have attained eligibility; and 2) participants who have not attained eligibility. The open group adds future participants to the closed group.

Liabilities also include environmental and disposal liabilities, benefits due and payable, as well as insur ance and guarantee program liabilities. As with reported assets, the government’s responsibilities, policy commitments, and contingencies are much broader than these reported Balance Sheet liabilities. They include the social insurance programs reported in the SOSI and disclosed in the unaudited RSI—Social Insurance section, fiscal long -term projections of non- interest spending reported in the SLTFP, and a wide range of other programs under which the government provides benefits and services to the people of this nation, as well as certain future loss contingencies. The government has entered into contractual commitments requiring the future use of financial resources and has unresolved contingencies where existing conditions, situations, or circumstances create uncertainty about future losses. Commitments and contingencies that do not meet the criteria for recognition as liabilities on the Balance Sheets, but for which there is at least a reasonable possibility that losses have been incurred, are disclosed in Note 20 —Commitments and Note 21—Contingencies. The collection of certain taxes and other revenue is credited to the corresponding funds from dedicated collections that will use these funds to meet a particular government purpose. If the collections from taxes and other sources exceed the payments to the beneficiaries, the excess revenue is invested in Treasury securities or deposited in the General Fund; therefore, the trust fund balances do not represent cash. An explanation of the trust funds for social insurance is included in Note 22—Funds from Dedicated Collections. That note also contains information about trust fund receipts, disbursements, and assets. Due to its sovereign power to tax and borrow, and the country’s wide economic base, the government has unique access to financial resources through generating tax revenues and issuing federal debt securities. This provides the government with the ability to meet present obligations and those that are anticipated from future operations and are not reflected in net position. The net position is the residual difference between assets and liabilities and is the cumulative results of operations since inception. For detailed components that comprise the net position, refer to the section “Statement of Operations and Changes in Net Position.” SUSTAINABILITY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The sustainability financial statements are comprised of the SLTFP, covering all federal government programs, and the SOSI and the SCSIA, covering social insurance programs (Social Security, Medicare, Railroad Retirement, and Black Lung programs). The sustainability financial statements are designed to illustrate the relationship between projected receipts and expenditures if current policy is continued over a 75 -year time horizon. 1 In preparing the sustainability financial statements, management selects assumptions and data that it believes provide a reasonable basis to illustrate whether current policy is sustainable. Current policy is based on current law but includes several adjustments. In the SLTFP, notable adjustments to current law are: 1) projected spending, receipts, and borrowing levels assume raising or suspending the current statutory lim it on federal debt; 2) continued discretionary appropriations are assumed throughout the projections period; 3) scheduled Social Security and Medicare Part A benefit payments are assumed to occur beyond the projected point of trust fund depletion; and 4) many mandatory programs with expiration dates prior to the end of the 75- year projection period are assumed to be reauthorized. In the SOSI, the one adjustment to current law is that scheduled Social Security and Medicare Part A benefit payments are assumed to occur beyond the projected point of trust fund depletions. Assumptions underlying such sustainability information do not consider changes in policy or all potential future events that could affect future income, future expenditures, and, hence, sustainability. The projections do not reflect any adverse economic consequences resulting from continuously rising debt levels. A large number of factors affect the sustainability financial statements and future eve nts and circumstances cannot be estimated with certainty. Therefore, even if current policy is continued, there will be differenc es between the estimates in the\n\nNOTES TO THE FY 2024 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 146 The Boards of Trustees 21 of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds provide in their annual reports to Congress short-range (10-year) and long- range (75-year) actuarial estimates of each trust fund. Significant uncertainty surrounds the estimates, especially for a period as long as 75 years. To illustrate the range of uncertainty, the Trustees use three altern ative scenarios (low -cost, intermediate, and high -cost) that use specific assumptions. These assumptions include fertility rates, rates of change in mortality, LPR and other than LPR immigration levels, emigration levels, changes in real GDP, changes in the CPI, changes in average real wages, unemployment rates, trust fund real yield rates, and disability incidence and recover y rates. The assumptions used for the most recent set of projections shown above in the Social Security and Medicare demographic and economic assumption table are generally referred to as the “intermediate assumptions,” and reflect the Trustees reasonable estimate of expected future experience. For additional information on Social Security and Medicare demographic and economic assumptions, refer to SSA’s and HHS’s financial statement s. The RRB’s estimated future revenues and expenditures reflected in the SOSI are based on various economic, employment, and other actuarial assumptions, and assume that the program will continue as presently constructed. For further details on actuarial assumptions related to the program and how these assumptions affect amounts presented on the SOSI and SCSIA, consult the Technical Supplement to the 29th Actuarial Valuation of the Assets and Liabilities Under the Railroad Retirement Acts as of December 31, 2022 with Technical Supplement, which also serves as t he 2024 Annual Report of the Railroad Retirement System required by Section 502 of the Railroad Retirement Solvency Act of 1983 (P.L. 98 -76), and RRB’s financial statements. The B LDBP significant assumptions used in the projections are the coal excise tax revenue estimates, the tax rate structure, the number of beneficiaries, life expectancy, federal civilian pay raises, medical cost inflation, and the interest rates used to discount future cash flows. Statement of Changes in Social Insurance Amounts The SCSIA reconciles the change (between the current valuation and the prior valuation) in the PV of estimated future revenue less estimated future expenditures for current and future participants (the open group measure) over the next 75 year s (except Black Lung which has a rolling 25- year projection period). The reconciliation identifies several components of the changes that are significant and provides reasons for the changes. The following disclosures relate to the SCSIA including the reasons for the components of the changes in the open group measure during the reporting period from the end of the previous reporting period for the government’s social insurance programs. All estimates relating to the Social Security and Medicare Programs in the SCSIA represent values that are incremental to the prior change. In general, a decrease in the PV of future net cash outflows represents a positive change (improving financing), while a n increase in the PV of future net cash out flows represents a negative change (worsening financing). For additional information regarding the estimates used to prepare the SCSIA, see SSA’s, HHS’s, RRB’s, and DOL’s financial statements. Assumptions Used for the Components of the Changes The PV included in the SCSIA are for the current and prior years and are based on various economic as well as demographic assumptions used for the intermediate assumptions in the Social Security and Medicare Trustees Report for these years. The Social Security and Medicare – Demographic and Economic Assumptions table summarizes these assumptions for the current year. This year’s SOSI projections for Social Security and Medicare, which are as of January 1, 2024, are based on the same demographic and economic assumptions that underlie the 2024 Social Security and Medicare Trustees Report."

These General Fund transfers that are used to finance Medicare Parts B and D are also shown as eliminations on these calculations. For the FYs 2024 and 202 3, the amounts eliminated totaled $50.2 trillion and $48.5 trillion, respectively. The SOSI also includes projected general revenues that, under current law, would be used to finance the remainder of the expenditures in excess of revenues for Medicare Parts B and D that is reported in the SOSI. Expenditures include benefit payments scheduled under current law and administrative expenses. Once the reserves in the trust funds are depleted, under current law benefits for Social Security and Medicare Part A can be paid only to the extent there are resources from dedicated income sources. Social insurance programs utilize “trust funds” to account for dedicated collections held for later use to accomplish the program’s purpose. Expenditures reflect full benefit payments even after the point at which trust fund asset reserves are projected to be depleted. Refer to the unaudited RSI–Social Insurance section and SSA’s, HHS’s, RRB’s, and DOL’s financial statements for additional information on Social Security, Medicare, Railroad Retirement, and Black Lung program financing. The estimates in the consolidated SOSI of the open group measures are for persons who are participants or eventually will participate in the programs as contributors (workers) or beneficiaries (retired workers, survivors, dependents, and disabled) during the 75 -year projection period. The closed group comprises only current participants which are those who have attained age 15 at the start of the projection period. Actuarial PV of estimated future income (excluding interest) and estimated future expenditures for the Social Security and Medicare social insurance programs are presented for three differen t groups of participants: 1) current participants who have not yet attained eligibility age; 2) current participants who have attained eligibility age; and 3) new entrants, who are expected to become participants in the future. Current participants in the Social Security and Medicare programs are the closed group of taxpayers and/or beneficiaries who are aged at least 15 years at the start of the projection period. Future participants for Social Security and Medicare include those born during the projection period and individuals below age 15 as of January 1 of the valuation year. Railroad Retirement’s future participants are the projected new entrants as of October 1 of the valuation year. The trust fund balances as of the valuation date for the respective programs, including interest earned, are shown in the table below. 20 The PV of estimated future expenditures in\n\n171 FY 2024 REQUIRED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) Social Insurance The social insurance programs consisting of Social Security, Medicare, Railroad Retirement, Black Lung, and UI were developed to provide income security and health care coverage to citizens under specific circumstances as a responsibility of the government. Because taxpayers rely on these programs in their long -term planning, social insurance program information should indicate whether the current statutory provisions of the programs can be sustained, and more generally what effect these provisions likely have on the government’s financial condition. The resources needed to run these programs are raised through taxes and fees. Eligibility for benefits depends in part on earnings and time worked by the individuals. Social Security benefits are generally redistributed intentionally toward lower -wage workers (i.e., benefits are progressive). In addition, each social insurance program has a uniform set of eligibility events and schedules that apply to all participants. RSI material is generally drawn from the 2024 Annual Reports of the Boards of Trustees, which represents the official government evaluation of the financial and actuarial status of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds. Unless otherwise noted, all data are for calendar years, all projections are based on current law and the Trustees intermediate set of assumptions. A significant exception is that the projections disregard benefit payment reductions that would result from the projected depletion of the OASDI and HI Trust Funds. Under current law, benefit payments would be reduced to levels that could be covered by incoming tax and premium revenues when the trust fund balances have been depleted. Social Security and Medicare Social Security The OASI and DI Trust Funds were established on January 1, 1940 and August 1, 1956, respectively as separate accounts in Treasury. The OASI fund pays cash retirement benefits to eligible retirees and their eligible dependents and survivors, and the much smaller DI fund pays cash benefits to eligible individuals who are unable to work because of medical conditions and certain family members of such eligible individuals. All financial operations of the OASI and DI Programs are handled through these respective funds. The two funds are often referred to as the combined OASDI Trust Funds or “Social Security.” At the end of calendar year 2023, Social Security benefits were paid to approximately 67 million beneficiaries. The events that trigger benefit payments are quite different however, both trust funds have the same dedicated financing structure: taxes paid by workers, their employers, and individuals with self -employment income, based on work covered by the Social Security Program. Currently, employers and employees each pay 6.2 percent of taxable earnings, and the self - employed pay 12.4 percent of taxable earnings. Payroll taxes are levied on wages and net earnings from self -employment up to a specified maximum annual amount, referred to as maximum taxable earnings ($168,600.00 in 2024), that increases each year with economy-wide average wages. Legislation passed in 1984 subjected up to half of Social Security benefits to income tax and allocated the revenue to the OASDI Trust Funds. In 1993 legislation increased the potentially taxed portion of benefits to 85.0 percent and allocated the additional revenue to the Medicare’s HI Trust Fund. Medicare The Medicare Program, created in 1965, has two separate trust funds: the HI Trust Fund (otherwise known as Medicare Part A) and the SMI Trust Funds (which consists of the Medicare Part B and Part D 9 accounts). HI helps pay for inpatient hospital skilled nursing facility, home health, and hospice. SMI helps pay for hospital outpatient services, physician servic es, and assorted other services and products through Part B and for prescription drugs through Part D. Though the events that trigger benefit payments are similar, HI and SMI have different dedicated financing structures. Similar to Social Security, HI is financed primarily by payroll contributions. Currently, employers and employees each pay 1.45 percent of earnings, while self -employed workers pay 2.9 percent of their net earnings. SMI is\n\nAmounts reported in t he SOSI and in the RSI section in this Financial Report are based on each program’s official actuarial calculations. This year’s projections for Social Security and Medicare are based on the same economic and demographic assumptions that underlie the 2024 Social Security and Medicare Trustees Reports and the 2024 SOSI, while comparative information presented from last year’s report is based on the 2023 Social Security and Medicare Trustees Reports and the 2023 SOSI. Table 7 summarizes amounts reported in the SOSI, showing that net social insurance expenditures are projected to be $78.3 trillion over 75 years as of January 1, 2024 for the open group, remaining largely unchanged, decreasing by approximately $100.0 billion compared to net expenditures of $78.4 trillion projected in the FY 2023 Financial Report . 25 24 The Black Lung Benefits Act provides for monthly payments and medical benefits to coal miners totally disabled from pneumoconiosis (black lung disease) arising from their employment in or around the nation's coal mines. See RRB’s projections are based on economic and demographic assumptions that underlie the 29th Actuarial Valuation of the Assets and Liabilities Under the Railroad Retirement Acts as of December 31, 20 22 with Technical Supplement, which also serves as the Annual Report for 2024 , and the 2023 Annual Report on the Railroad Retirement System required by Section 502 of the Railroad Retirement Solvency Act of 1983 (P.L. 98-76). 25 Closed group and open group differ by the population included in each calculation. From the SOSI, the closed group includes: 1) participants who have attained eligibility; and 2) participants who have not attained eligibility. The open group adds future participants to the closed group. See ‘Social Insurance’ in the RSI section in this Financial Report for more information.\n\nFY 2024 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 56 benefits payable. Liabilities also include environmental and disposal liabilities, benefits due and payable, as well as insur ance and guarantee program liabilities. As with reported assets, the government’s responsibilities, policy commitments, and contingencies are much broader than these reported Balance Sheet liabilities. They include the social insurance programs reported in the SOSI and disclosed in the unaudited RSI—Social Insurance section, fiscal long -term projections of non- interest spending reported in the SLTFP, and a wide range of other programs under which the government provides benefits and services to the people of this nation, as well as certain future loss contingencies. The government has entered into contractual commitments requiring the future use of financial resources and has unresolved contingencies where existing conditions, situations, or circumstances create uncertainty about future losses. Commitments and contingencies that do not meet the criteria for recognition as liabilities on the Balance Sheets, but for which there is at least a reasonable possibility that losses have been incurred, are disclosed in Note 20 —Commitments and Note 21—Contingencies. The collection of certain taxes and other revenue is credited to the corresponding funds from dedicated collections that will use these funds to meet a particular government purpose. If the collections from taxes and other sources exceed the payments to the beneficiaries, the excess revenue is invested in Treasury securities or deposited in the General Fund; therefore, the trust fund balances do not represent cash. An explanation of the trust funds for social insurance is included in Note 22—Funds from Dedicated Collections. That note also contains information about trust fund receipts, disbursements, and assets. Due to its sovereign power to tax and borrow, and the country’s wide economic base, the government has unique access to financial resources through generating tax revenues and issuing federal debt securities. This provides the government with the ability to meet present obligations and those that are anticipated from future operations and are not reflected in net position. The net position is the residual difference between assets and liabilities and is the cumulative results of operations since inception. For detailed components that comprise the net position, refer to the section “Statement of Operations and Changes in Net Position.” SUSTAINABILITY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The sustainability financial statements are comprised of the SLTFP, covering all federal government programs, and the SOSI and the SCSIA, covering social insurance programs (Social Security, Medicare, Railroad Retirement, and Black Lung programs). The sustainability financial statements are designed to illustrate the relationship between projected receipts and expenditures if current policy is continued over a 75 -year time horizon. 1 In preparing the sustainability financial statements, management selects assumptions and data that it believes provide a reasonable basis to illustrate whether current policy is sustainable. Current policy is based on current law but includes several adjustments. In the SLTFP, notable adjustments to current law are: 1) projected spending, receipts, and borrowing levels assume raising or suspending the current statutory lim it on federal debt; 2) continued discretionary appropriations are assumed throughout the projections period; 3) scheduled Social Security and Medicare Part A benefit payments are assumed to occur beyond the projected point of trust fund depletion; and 4) many mandatory programs with expiration dates prior to the end of the 75- year projection period are assumed to be reauthorized. In the SOSI, the one adjustment to current law is that scheduled Social Security and Medicare Part A benefit payments are assumed to occur beyond the projected point of trust fund depletions. Assumptions underlying such sustainability information do not consider changes in policy or all potential future events that could affect future income, future expenditures, and, hence, sustainability. The projections do not reflect any adverse economic consequences resulting from continuously rising debt levels. A large number of factors affect the sustainability financial statements and future eve nts and circumstances cannot be estimated with certainty. Therefore, even if current policy is continued, there will be differenc es between the estimates in the\n\nNOTES TO THE FY 2024 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 146 The Boards of Trustees 21 of the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds provide in their annual reports to Congress short-range (10-year) and long- range (75-year) actuarial estimates of each trust fund. Significant uncertainty surrounds the estimates, especially for a period as long as 75 years. To illustrate the range of uncertainty, the Trustees use three altern ative scenarios (low -cost, intermediate, and high -cost) that use specific assumptions. These assumptions include fertility rates, rates of change in mortality, LPR and other than LPR immigration levels, emigration levels, changes in real GDP, changes in the CPI, changes in average real wages, unemployment rates, trust fund real yield rates, and disability incidence and recover y rates. The assumptions used for the most recent set of projections shown above in the Social Security and Medicare demographic and economic assumption table are generally referred to as the “intermediate assumptions,” and reflect the Trustees reasonable estimate of expected future experience. For additional information on Social Security and Medicare demographic and economic assumptions, refer to SSA’s and HHS’s financial statement s. The RRB’s estimated future revenues and expenditures reflected in the SOSI are based on various economic, employment, and other actuarial assumptions, and assume that the program will continue as presently constructed. For further details on actuarial assumptions related to the program and how these assumptions affect amounts presented on the SOSI and SCSIA, consult the Technical Supplement to the 29th Actuarial Valuation of the Assets and Liabilities Under the Railroad Retirement Acts as of December 31, 2022 with Technical Supplement, which also serves as t he 2024 Annual Report of the Railroad Retirement System required by Section 502 of the Railroad Retirement Solvency Act of 1983 (P.L. 98 -76), and RRB’s financial statements. The B LDBP significant assumptions used in the projections are the coal excise tax revenue estimates, the tax rate structure, the number of beneficiaries, life expectancy, federal civilian pay raises, medical cost inflation, and the interest rates used to discount future cash flows. Statement of Changes in Social Insurance Amounts The SCSIA reconciles the change (between the current valuation and the prior valuation) in the PV of estimated future revenue less estimated future expenditures for current and future participants (the open group measure) over the next 75 year s (except Black Lung which has a rolling 25- year projection period). The reconciliation identifies several components of the changes that are significant and provides reasons for the changes. The following disclosures relate to the SCSIA including the reasons for the components of the changes in the open group measure during the reporting period from the end of the previous reporting period for the government’s social insurance programs. All estimates relating to the Social Security and Medicare Programs in the SCSIA represent values that are incremental to the prior change. In general, a decrease in the PV of future net cash outflows represents a positive change (improving financing), while a n increase in the PV of future net cash out flows represents a negative change (worsening financing). For additional information regarding the estimates used to prepare the SCSIA, see SSA’s, HHS’s, RRB’s, and DOL’s financial statements. Assumptions Used for the Components of the Changes The PV included in the SCSIA are for the current and prior years and are based on various economic as well as demographic assumptions used for the intermediate assumptions in the Social Security and Medicare Trustees Report for these years. The Social Security and Medicare – Demographic and Economic Assumptions table summarizes these assumptions for the current year. This year’s SOSI projections for Social Security and Medicare, which are as of January 1, 2024, are based on the same demographic and economic assumptions that underlie the 2024 Social Security and Medicare Trustees Report."

      "188 | Chapter 5 energy from dammed water into electricity, provided 6 percent of electricity generation in 2023 (EIA 2024d). Hydropower is renewable, and it can be operated to provide stable generation or flexibly to complement wind and solar (DOE 2024c). While its potential to scale up is limited by natural resources (Fendt and Parsons 2021), the DOE estimates that significant new hydropower generation could be added by 2050 through upgrades to existing plants, adding capacity at existing dams and canals, and limited develop - ment of new stream-reaches, in addition to the potential for new pumped storage capacity already discussed (DOE 2024c). Nuclear energy provides roughly 20 percent of current electricity gen- eration in the United States. Nuclear plants have high fixed costs and low variable costs, making them well-suited for stable production. Most U.S. nuclear plants are large light-water reactors, which can offer low marginal costs per megawatt-hour due to economies of scale (DOE 2024d). In addi- tion, investments in small modular reactors (SMRs), which have a smaller geographic footprint than traditional reactors and can be partially prefabri - cated offsite, can potentially allow for faster, cheaper construction in areas unsuitable for standard nuclear facilities. While SMRs may cost more per megawatt-hour than large reactors, they may be more suitable for replacing smaller retiring coal plants or industrial processes requiring high heat, and they may be more attainable for investors with limited land, labor, and capi- tal (DOE 2024d). Recent technological advancements have improved their suitability for flexible production as well (Renteria, Schwartz, and Jenkins 2024), implying that nuclear could be used as a replacement for natural gas plants in complementing variable renewables. Concerns about rare disasters and the challenges of storing nuclear waste have given rise to safety regulations that drive up the cost of nuclear energy (Lovering, Yip, and Nordhaus 2016), likely contributing to the decline in the construction of new plants since the 1980s (Makarin, Qian, and Wang 2024). However, nuclear plants can be safely built and operated at economically viable costs (Ritchie 2020). For example, France opened its first nuclear plant in the 1960s and produces the majority of its electricity using nuclear power today (EIA 2023). Scaling up U.S. nuclear power would require catalyzing private sector investments by streamlining regulation and investing in innovation, demonstration, and deployment (DOE 2024d; White House 2024a). The IRA provides tax credits for nuclear energy production and investment, and the Biden-Harris Administration funds a number of demonstration and research programs, offers low-cost loans for deployment of commercial technologies, and signed the ADVANCE Act to increase licensing efficiency (DOE 2024d).\n\n111 NOTES TO THE FY 2024 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 14.

The nuclear complex was comprised of nuclear reactors, chemical -processing buildings, metal machining plants, laboratories, and maintenance facilities. At all sites where these activities took place, some environmental contamination occurred. This contamination was caused by the production, storage, and use of radioactive materials and hazardous chemicals, which resulted in contamination of soil, surface water, or groundwater. The environmental legacy of nuclear weapons production also includes thousands of contaminated buildings and large volumes of waste and special nuclear materials requiring treatment, stabilization, and disposal. Estimated cleanup costs at sites for which there are no current feasible remediation approaches are excluded from the estimates, although applicable stewardship and monitoring costs for these sites are included. DOE has not been required through regulation to establish remediation activities for these sites. Estimating DOE’s environmental cleanup liability requires making assumptions about future activities and is inherently uncertain. The future course of DOE’s environmental cleanup and disposal will depend on a number of fundamental technical and policy choices, many of which have not been made. Some contaminated sites and facilities could be restored to a condition suitable for any desired use or could be restored to a point where they pose no near -term health risks to the surrounding communities. Achieving the former condition of the sites and facilities would have a higher cost which may or may not warrant the cost or be legally required. The environmental and disposal liability estimates include contingency estimates intended to account for the uncertainties associated with the technical cleanup scope of the program. Congressional appropriations at lower -than anticipated levels or lack of congressional approval, unplanned delays in project completions, unforeseen technical issues, obtaining regulatory approval, among other things, could cause increases in life -cycle costs. DOE’s environmental and disposal liabilities also include the estimated cleanup and post -closure responsibilities, including surveillance and monitoring activities, soil and groundwater remediation, and disposition of excess material for sites. DOE is responsible for the post -closure activities at many of the closure sites as well as other sites. The costs for these post-closure activities are estimated for a period of 75 years after the balance sheet date, i.e., through 2099 in FY 2024 and through 209 8 in FY 2023. While some post -cleanup monitoring and other long -term stewardship activities post- 2099 are included in the liability, there are others DOE expects to continue beyond 2099 for which the costs cannot reasonably be estimated. A portion of DOE’s environmental liability at various field sites includes anticipated costs for facilities managed by DOE’s ongoing program operations, which will ultimately require stabilization, deactivation, and decommissioning. The estimates are largely based upon a cost -estimating model. Site specific estimates are used in lieu of the cost- estimating model, when available. Cost estimates for ongoing program facilities are updated each year. For facilities newly contaminated since FY 1997, cleanup costs are allocated to the periods benefiting from the operations of the facilities. Facilities’ cleanup costs allocated to future periods and not included in the environmental and disposal liabilities amounted to $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion for fiscal years ending September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

I n accordance with contract terms, specific rights to the contractors’ work vest when a specific type of contract financing payment is made. Due to the probability the contractors will complete their efforts and deliver satisfactory products, and because the amount of potential future payments is estimable, the SAA has recognized a contingent liability for estimated future payments, which are conditional pending delivery and government acceptance.

The CERCLA, SARA, and RCRA require DOD to clean up contamination in coordination with regulatory entities, current owners of property damaged by DOD, and third parties that have a partial responsibility for the environmental restoration. Failure to comply with agreements and legal mandates puts the DOD at risk of incurring fines and penalties. DOD utilizes an estimating methodology model which includes the use of mathematical equations to con vert resources data into cost data to project environmental cleanup cost. DOD validates the models and estimates liabilities based on data received during preliminary assessment and site investigation. For PP&E placed into service after September 30, 1997, DOD expenses associated environmental cleanup costs using two methods: physical capacity usage of the assets or systematically recognized over the use ful life. DOD expensed cleanup costs for PP&E placed into service before October 1, 1997, unless costs are to be recovered through user charges. As costs are recovered DOD expenses cleanup costs associated with the asset life that has passed since the PP&E was placed into service. DOD systematically recognizes the remaining cost over the remaining life of the asset. The unrecognized portion of the estimated total cleanup costs associated with disposal of PP&E was $ 5.2 billion and $4.7 billion for fiscal years ending September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. DOD is responsible for environmental restoration and corrective action for buried chemical munitions and agents; however, a reasonable estimate is indeterminable because the extent of the buried chemical munitions and agents is unknown. DOD has ongoing studies for the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program and will update its estimate as additional information is identified. DOD may incur costs for restoration initiatives in conjunction with returning overseas DOD facilities to host nations. DOD continues its efforts to reasonably estimate required restoration costs. Environmental liabilities change over time because of laws and regulation updates, technology advances, inflation or deflation factors and disposal plan revisions. DOD revised estimates resulting from previously unknown contaminants, reestimation based on different assumptions, and other changes in project scope. Please refer to the financial statements of the main contributing entities, DOD and DOE, for additional information regarding environmental and disposal liabilities, including cleanup costs. Legal contingent liabilities including contingencies related to environmental legal disputes are recognized as an other liability on the Balance Sheet. See Note 18 —Other Liabilities and Note 21—Contingencies for additional information related to legal contingencies.\n\nAchieving a Net Zero Carbon Dioxide Emissions Economy in the United States | 175 aim to deliver additional economic and community benefits. Since 2021, nearly 900 new or expanded clean energy manufacturing facilities have been announced, many since the passage of the BIL and IRA (DOE 2024a). Further, as a result of the IRA, more private clean energy funding is now going to economically disadvantaged communities (Van Nostrand and Ashenfarb 2023). Historical Energy-related CO2 Emissions Trends U.S. CO 2 emissions from energy use peaked in 2007, then began to fall slowly (EIA 2024a). However, the trend in aggregate emissions masks important differences by sector—electric power, transportation, industrial (including agriculture), residential and commercial buildings—each of which face distinct economic challenges to decarbonization. Figure 5-1a presents energy-related CO2 emissions by sector. In 2023, transportation accounted for 39 percent of energy-related emissions, fol- lowed by the electric power sector at 30 percent and the industrial sector at 20 percent. Finally, the residential and commercial sectors together made up 12 percent of total energy-related emissions. When emissions from the electric power sector are distributed to the other sectors according to their electricity use, transportation contributed 39 percent, industrial contributed 28 percent, and residential and commercial buildings together contributed 33 percent of CO2 emissions (EIA 2024b). Figure 5-1b shows a notable decrease in emissions from the electric power sector, in part because the United States has produced more electricity from carbon-free sources, including wind and solar, since 2010 and in part because of a switch from coal to natural gas fossil fuel use (EIA 2024a). Emissions per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated have fallen by roughly one third since 1990 (see figure 5-2). Figure 5-3 shows the extent of electrification by sector from 1949– 2023. Electrification increased rapidly in both residential and commercial buildings from the 1950s to the 2000s, then slowed. In contrast, electrifica - tion has increased only slightly in the industrial sector. The flat transporta- tion trend shown in figure 5-3 underestimates electrification because the data do not include at-home EV charging, which is measured as residential energy use. Still, it is difficult to electrify certain forms of transportation, such as heavy trucking, aviation, and international maritime shipping (Jaramillo et al. 2023). On average, electrification has increased gradually throughout the economy, from less than 5 percent of end-use energy in 1949 to nearly 20 percent in 2023."

      "111 NOTES TO THE FY 2024 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Note 14. Environmental and Disposal Liabilities Environmental and Disposal Liabilities as of September 30, 2024, and 2023 (In billions of dollars) 2024 2023 Department of Energy 544.5 534.3 Department of Defense 101.1 93.8 All other entities 20.4 17.2 Total environmental and disposal liabilities 666.0 645.3 After World War II , the U.S. developed a massive industrial complex to research, produce, and test nuclear weapons and commercial nuclear power reactors . The nuclear complex was comprised of nuclear reactors, chemical -processing buildings, metal machining plants, laboratories, and maintenance facilities. At all sites where these activities took place, some environmental contamination occurred. This contamination was caused by the production, storage, and use of radioactive materials and hazardous chemicals, which resulted in contamination of soil, surface water, or groundwater. The environmental legacy of nuclear weapons production also includes thousands of contaminated buildings and large volumes of waste and special nuclear materials requiring treatment, stabilization, and disposal. Estimated cleanup costs at sites for which there are no current feasible remediation approaches are excluded from the estimates, although applicable stewardship and monitoring costs for these sites are included. DOE has not been required through regulation to establish remediation activities for these sites. Estimating DOE’s environmental cleanup liability requires making assumptions about future activities and is inherently uncertain. The future course of DOE’s environmental cleanup and disposal will depend on a number of fundamental technical and policy choices, many of which have not been made. Some contaminated sites and facilities could be restored to a condition suitable for any desired use or could be restored to a point where they pose no near -term health risks to the surrounding communities. Achieving the former condition of the sites and facilities would have a higher cost which may or may not warrant the cost or be legally required. The environmental and disposal liability estimates include contingency estimates intended to account for the uncertainties associated with the technical cleanup scope of the program. Congressional appropriations at lower -than anticipated levels or lack of congressional approval, unplanned delays in project completions, unforeseen technical issues, obtaining regulatory approval, among other things, could cause increases in life -cycle costs. DOE’s environmental and disposal liabilities also include the estimated cleanup and post -closure responsibilities, including surveillance and monitoring activities, soil and groundwater remediation, and disposition of excess material for sites. DOE is responsible for the post -closure activities at many of the closure sites as well as other sites. The costs for these post-closure activities are estimated for a period of 75 years after the balance sheet date, i.e., through 2099 in FY 2024 and through 209 8 in FY 2023. While some post -cleanup monitoring and other long -term stewardship activities post- 2099 are included in the liability, there are others DOE expects to continue beyond 2099 for which the costs cannot reasonably be estimated. A portion of DOE’s environmental liability at various field sites includes anticipated costs for facilities managed by DOE’s ongoing program operations, which will ultimately require stabilization, deactivation, and decommissioning. The estimates are largely based upon a cost -estimating model. Site specific estimates are used in lieu of the cost- estimating model, when available. Cost estimates for ongoing program facilities are updated each year. For facilities newly contaminated since FY 1997, cleanup costs are allocated to the periods benefiting from the operations of the facilities. Facilities’ cleanup costs allocated to future periods and not included in the environmental and disposal liabilities amounted to $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion for fiscal years ending September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. DOD has cleanup requirements and conducts the cleanup under DERP at active installations, Base Realignment Closure, and Formerly Used Defense Sites. DOD has additional cleanup requirements for active installations not driven by\n\nto the periods benefiting from the operations of the facilities. Facilities’ cleanup costs allocated to future periods and not included in the environmental and disposal liabilities amounted to $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion for fiscal years ending September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. DOD has cleanup requirements and conducts the cleanup under DERP at active installations, Base Realignment Closure, and Formerly Used Defense Sites. DOD has additional cleanup requirements for active installations not driven by DERP, weapon systems programs, and chemical weapons disposal programs. The weapons system program consists of chemical weapons disposal, nuclear powered aircraft carriers, nuclear powered submarines, and other nuclear ships. All cleanup efforts are performed in coordination with regulatory entities , other responsible parties, and current property owners, as applicable.\n\nNOTES TO THE FY 2024 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 112 DOD follows CERCLA, SARA, RCRA or other applicable federal or state laws to clean up contamination. The CERCLA, SARA, and RCRA require DOD to clean up contamination in coordination with regulatory entities, current owners of property damaged by DOD, and third parties that have a partial responsibility for the environmental restoration. Failure to comply with agreements and legal mandates puts the DOD at risk of incurring fines and penalties. DOD utilizes an estimating methodology model which includes the use of mathematical equations to con vert resources data into cost data to project environmental cleanup cost. DOD validates the models and estimates liabilities based on data received during preliminary assessment and site investigation. For PP&E placed into service after September 30, 1997, DOD expenses associated environmental cleanup costs using two methods: physical capacity usage of the assets or systematically recognized over the use ful life. DOD expensed cleanup costs for PP&E placed into service before October 1, 1997, unless costs are to be recovered through user charges. As costs are recovered DOD expenses cleanup costs associated with the asset life that has passed since the PP&E was placed into service. DOD systematically recognizes the remaining cost over the remaining life of the asset. The unrecognized portion of the estimated total cleanup costs associated with disposal of PP&E was $ 5.2 billion and $4.7 billion for fiscal years ending September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. DOD is responsible for environmental restoration and corrective action for buried chemical munitions and agents; however, a reasonable estimate is indeterminable because the extent of the buried chemical munitions and agents is unknown.

See Note 18 —Other Liabilities and Note 21—Contingencies for additional information related to legal contingencies.\n\n125 NOTES TO THE FY 2024 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Legal Contingencies and Environmental and Disposal Contingencies Legal Contingencies and Environmental and Disposal Contingencies as of September 30, 2024, and 2023 2024 2023 Estimated Range of Loss Estimated Range of Loss for Certain Cases 2 for Certain Cases 2 Accrued Accrued (In billions of dollars) Liabilities 1 Lower End Upper End Liabilities 1 Lower End Upper End Probable 51.9 51.7 67.6 55.9 55.4 66.3 Reasonably possible N/A 23.9 125.1 N/A 10.6 107.4 1 Accrued liabilities are recorded and presented in other liabilities on the Balance Sheet. 2 Does not reflect the total range of loss; many cases assessed as reasonably possible of an unfavorable outcome did not include estimated losses that could be determined. Note: \"N/A\" indicates not applicable. Management and legal counsel have determined that it is “probable” that some legal actions, litigation, tort claims, and environmental and disposal contingencies will result in a loss to the government and the loss amounts are reasonably measurable. The estimated liabilities for “probable” cases against the government are $51.9 billion and $55.9 billion as of September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and are included in “Other Liabilities” on the Balance Sheet. An example of a probable contingency that could result in a loss against the government for DOE and HHS is provided below. DOE, in accordance with the NWPA, entered into more than 69 standard contracts with utilities in which, in return for payment of fees into the Nuclear Waste Fund, DOE agreed to begin disposal of SNF by January 31, 1998. Because DOE has no facility available to receive SNF under the NWPA, it has been unable to begin disposal of the utilities’ SNF as required b y the contracts. Significant litigation claiming damages for partial breach of contract has ensued as a result of this delay. B ased on settlement estimates, the estimated total liability as of September 30, 2024 is in a range between $48.7 billion and $55.6 billion. After deducting the cumulative amount paid of $11.1 billion as of September 30, 2024 under these settlements, and as a result of final judgments, the remaining liability is estimated to be in the range of between $37.6 billion and $44.5 billi on. The U.S. Supreme Court 2012 decision in Salazar v. Ramah Navajo Chapter , and subsequent cases related to contract support costs have resulted in increased claims against the Indian Health Service, which is a component within HHS. As a result of this decision, many tribes have filed claims. Some claims have been paid and others have been asserted but not yet settled. It is expected that some tribes will file additional claims for prior years. The estimated amount recorded for contr act support costs is $6.7 billion in FY 2024 and $6.4 billion in FY 2023. There are also administrative claims and legal actions pending where adverse decisions are considered by management and legal counsel as “reasonably possible” with an estimate of potential loss or a range of potential loss. The estimated potential losses reported for such claims and actions range from $23.9 billion to $125.1 billion as of September 30, 2024, and from $10.6 billion to $107.4 billion as of September 30, 2023. Numerous litigation cases are pending where the outcome is uncertain or it is reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred and where estimates cannot be made. There are other litigation cases where the plaintiffs have not made claims for specific dollar amounts, but the settlement may be\n\ncharacteristics, may pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment. Cleanup costs include, but are not limited to decontamination, decommissioning, site restoration, site monitoring, closure, and post -closure costs. PP&E recognition of an anticipated environmental disposal liability begins when the asset is placed in service. See Note 14—Environmental and Disposal Liabilities for additional information. M. Benefits Due and Payable A liability for social insurance programs (including but not limited to: Social Security, Medicare, Railroad Retirement, Black Lung, and Unemployment) is recognized for any unpaid amounts currently due and payable to beneficiaries or service providers as of the end of the reporting period. See Note 15—Benefits Due and Payable for additional information."
